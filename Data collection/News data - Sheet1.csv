Yet the nature of the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border—in which human- and drug-trafficking cartels, operating in partnership with foreign-state powers, control all illegal crossings and many legal ones—leads to the opposite conclusion that Mr. Galston reaches in declaring President Trump’s invocation of “invasion” as a mere “metaphor without legal validity or force.” Those cartels and their state partners and sponsors amply satisfy the twin criteria in our research: They enter our country, and they are actively inimical to our sovereignty. The millions of illegal aliens they traffic are their agents and means in a deliberate campaign of weaponized mass migration waged against the U.S.

Mr. Trump is thus substantively and constitutionally correct when he declares an invasion under way at America’s southern border."

The Labor Department said Wednesday that prices rose last month 0.5% from December on a seasonally adjusted basis. That was the largest monthly increase since August 2023 and well ahead of economists’ expectations for a milder increase of 0.3%.

The gain pushed 12-month inflation to 3% in January. That marked a pickup from December, when prices rose 2.9%.

Markets reacted swiftly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both fell. Bond yields jumped. 

“Inflation has now been around these rates for some time and clearly isn’t coming down decisively anymore,” said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.

Inflation was a significant factor in the November election. Many Americans were fed up with higher prices and thought that putting a new party in power would help. During his campaign, President Trump vowed that he would lower prices. 

Economists have said the import tariffs that Trump has started to impose could make inflation worse. Trump’s allies have said other moves, such as deregulating businesses and boosting energy production, could offset the effects of higher goods prices. 

The bigger-than-expected increase in prices last month largely reflected higher prices for used cars and auto insurance, said Omair Sharif, founder of the research firm Inflation Insights.

Core prices, which strip out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.4% from December on a seasonally adjusted basis, the largest increase in nearly two years. Core inflation was 3.3% over the year. 

Egg prices rose more than 15% from December, the largest increase since June 2015. That accounted for about two-thirds of the total monthly increase in grocery prices. A bird flu outbreak is fueling the price increase. 

Wednesday’s report was particularly discouraging because housing and rental costs, which have been moderating and are expected to continue to ease, weren’t the culprit. Instead, the latest report pointed to inflationary pressures across other goods and services that had seen a slowdown in price pressures recently.

“This was a painful report down the line,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.

The 3% gain in prices was more than the 2.9% expected by economists. 

For Fed officials who touted a slowdown in price pressures over the second half of 2024, “It has to leave them uncomfortable about how much disinflationary pressure is in the pipeline, and uncertain about whether they have a policy setting sufficient to bring inflation down to 2%,” said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank.

The Fed measures progress against its 2% target using a separate inflation gauge that stood at 2.6% in December. “We are close, but not there on inflation…. So we want to keep policy restrictive for now,” said Fed Chair Jerome Powell at a congressional hearing on Wednesday morning, after the release of the latest inflation report.
Luzzetti doesn’t expect the Fed to cut rates this year, in part because big tariff increases could lift prices of imported goods in the coming months, further complicating the Fed’s inflation fight. Wednesday’s report is likely to only strengthen the argument for holding steady. Trump’s election initially led businesses to see even better times ahead as executives focused on the potential for tax cuts and deregulation. Consumer confidence also surged, largely driven by new optimism among Republicans. 

But some signs of concern have crept in amid Trump’s rapid-fire tariff threats, deportation raids and constant executive orders. Preliminary results of a small-business survey by Vistage Worldwide for The Wall Street Journal show that a postelection pop in confidence was reversed in February. 

Trump said in a social-media post Wednesday, just before the data release, that interest rates should be lowered. Some of Trump’s economic advisers have recently struck a different tone, arguing that the Fed needs to get inflation fully under control before lowering rates.

Trump recently imposed 10% additional tariffs on Chinese imports. Sharif said that if they remain in place, he expects them to boost some consumer prices by March or April. When Trump imposed 20% tariffs on imported washing machines in February 2018, those duties started pushing up prices by April, Sharif said. Within three months, washing-machine prices rose by about 18.2%, nearly matching the tariff. “Not only did you get almost a one-to-one pass-through on the tariff, you got it in a very short period of time,” Sharif said.

Many companies tend to reset their prices in January, to reflect rising costs from the previous year. The turn-of-the-year bump has been especially large in each of the past three years following the outbreak of inflation in 2021.

Article content
Duke said in its third-quarter earnings release last year that it was “executing an ambitious clean energy transition” and noted its goals to emit net zero methane by 2030 and net zero carbon by 2050. The company’s fourth-quarter release on Thursday said it was “executing an ambitious energy transition,” dropping the world “clean” and leaving out the emissions goals.

“The strategy hasn’t changed,” Duke Chief Executive Officer Lynn Good said in an interview with Bloomberg TV, noting the company’s commitment to affordability, reliablity and increasingly clean energy. “We do see an uptick in gas generation that wouldn’t have been the case five years ago just as we put together plans on how we are going to serve the load in this moment.”

A Duke representative said in an email, “While our long-term business strategy and our climate goals remain the same, we recently adjusted the language in our company boilerplate to emphasize the near-term, essential nature of meeting our customers’ evolving needs and the increasing growth in front of us.”

Demand for electricity is surging with the rapid development of data centers and artificial intelligence, along with manufacturing and the overall electrification of the economy. The demand boom has made it more difficult for utilities to pursue climate targets such as retiring old coal plants and avoiding the construction of new gas plants.

The move comes as President Donald Trump is working to unleash US production and exports of fossil fuels, while also vowing to put an end to spending on climate-friendly policies he has deemed wasteful. Duke said late last year it would consider shifting its plans for coal plants if Trump follows through on his promises to terminate rules that stifle power-plant pollution.

Duke is currently starting construction on more than 2 gigawatts of natural-gas generation in North and South Carolina that was approved last year and expects to have about 5 gigawatts of new natural gas in service by the end of 2029, according to the company. The company is also building out clean power sources like solar farms and plans to add 10 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2029.

2025-02-13T00:19:38Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-02-12/is-being-single-bad-for-the-economy,"I was having a conversation recently about the future of wealth — what can I say, I am an economist — when I heard an argument that was so retro I thought it was 1982: America needs to revive the stigma against being single. As a single person myself, my first reaction was indignation. Then, after a few moments, another thought occurred to me: Maybe that’s not a terrible idea.

Americans aren’t getting married as much as they used to. In some ways that reflects a more liberated society in which people can live the lives they want, with no judgment. But the rise in singleness — as distinct from unmarried but living together — is creating what economists call a negative externality. Perhaps the stigma against singlehood had some benefit. Personally, if I must endure some cost to being single, I would prefer the disapproval of society over being taxed. And it may be more cost-effective.

But I am getting ahead of myself. The question of whether singlehood needs to be stigmatized, and if so how, depends on why more people are unpartnered in the first place.

Americans Are Marrying Less Than They Used To ...
Maybe it’s because economic progress has allowed women to be more choosy about who they marry, or not to marry at all

One popular theory is that men have just become less compelling to women. The sexual revolution and the shift to a more service-oriented economy resulted in a rise in stature for women: They have more education and more well-paid jobs, while many men are struggling in the new economy. Women find these guys unappealing, the theory goes, and see singlehood as a better alternative.

But “men are unappealing,” true as it may often be, is not enough of a reason to not get married. Marriage is becoming less common because there is less of a stigma to being unmarried — and there is less of a stigma because the nature of marriage changed as the economy did.

For most of human history, marriage was a necessary economic and social agreement, especially for women. The world was risky; there was little or no safety net, and people were more likely to die young. Women in particular had few jobs available to them and limited ways to improve their social status. Finding a partner was their best hedge — hence the stigma against being single.

Consider France between the world wars. It lost about a fifth of its young male population in World War I, which meant there were fewer men to marry. And yet marriage rates spiked after the war and stayed high for the next decade. Research shows that French women ended up marrying men they might have not otherwise considered: men out of their preferred age range, foreign men, men who in normal times would not have been “competitive” in the marriage market (read: early 20th century versions of incels), men who were widowed or divorced. Back then, the economic and social consequences of being unmarried were worse. So women settled because they had to.

Now women don’t have to settle. Not only do they have better economic prospects, but there is no stigma against singleness or single motherhood, even if it is more expensive. And there is now an expectation that a partner should be an intellectual, social and emotional equal. Assortative mating — marrying someone with similar economic and educational attainment — has become the norm.

College-educated women are still marrying, for the most part — even men without college degrees. The decline in marriage rates is most stark for American men and women without a college degree.

In some ways these are all positive developments. Women have more choices — both to wait for a good marriage and leave a bad one — and are more empowered. They can marry someone they have more of a peer relationship with, which may make for a more satisfying marriage. That may explain why divorce rates, like marriage rates, are also down.

... And They Are Getting Divorced Less Often, Too
Could the decline in the divorce rate be due to the fact that Americans are being more choosy about who they marry?

But there are negative externalities to a society with less marriage. Assortative mating may mean better marriages for those who do marry, but it also worsens economic inequality — with the worst consequences for the poorest, who are now less likely to marry and struggle more on a single income. The fall in marriage may also explain some of the decline in fertility, and the US needs more people.

Perhaps the stigma against being unmarried, even when there is less of an economic and social need to be married, had some value. At the same time, I shudder at the notion that my choices would be stigmatized, or that I would feel pressure to marry someone I am incompatible with — even if I do pose a cost to society. And while a little stigma might not be a bad thing, there is a limit. There would be no economic benefit from a return to the days when women felt compelled to enter or stay in terrible marriages.


All of which raises the question of whether a societal stigma can be calibrated just so. After all, those “compensating marriages” of interwar France did not result in more divorces. Then again, what choice did they have?

2025-02-14T23:15:30Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/613567/trump-youtube-videos-cfpb,"Nearly 400 videos that were posted on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s YouTube page have been removed, as the Trump administration continues to pare back the agency, including its team of skilled technologists.

The CFPB YouTube page, which has 15,000 subscribers and was created in 2011, has had every one of its videos removed as of Friday. An archived version of the page shows that as recently as February 8th, it hosted 386 videos. The archived page shows videos with titles like “Five tips for when you can’t pay your bills,” “How do I dispute an error on my credit report?” and “How can I improve my credit scores?”

Facebook and X accounts for the agency have also been taken down, although it’s unclear when. The homepage of the CFPB website delivers a 404 error message, though other pages on the site are still active.

The removals seem to be part of a larger dismantling of the agency, which oversees consumer protection issues in financial service. That’s an area that’s increasingly come to include tech players, including X; X is owned by Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk, who’s been leading the charge on slashing the federal workforce. About 20 technologists in the bureau were suddenly terminated on Thursday evening, The Verge reported, ravaging a team that provided deep expertise to help hold companies accountable for their financial technology services.

Across several agencies, the government has hurriedly removed webpages to comply with President Donald Trump’s flurry of executive orders at the start of his term. Many pages that hosted health information were brought back online this week to comply with a court order. Later, the Trump administration updated those pages with a disclaimer against “gender ideology,” noting it was forced by a court to restore the information.

There could be a brief reprieve for the CFPB after a new court order. On Friday evening, a judge put a pause on further firings of CFPB staff without cause, and ordered the agency not to delete agency records or data at least until a hearing on March 3rd."
2025-02-14T23:22:50Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/613572/google-earthquake-detection-false-alarm-sao-paulo-brasil-disabled,"Google has disabled its Android earthquake detection feature in Brazil after many smartphone users in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro received false emergency alerts on Friday morning, Android Police reports. The alerts of a nonexistent 5.5 magnitude earthquake were sent to devices around 2AM this morning, and pinpointed earthquakes in the country’s Ubatuba and Baixada Santista regions.

Google launched the earthquake detection network that uses accelerometers in Android devices as a seismometer in California in 2020, and over the years, it has expanded to other countries.

According to CNN Brasil, the Civil Defense of São Paulo, which manages an early warning system for disaster risk, said it “did not issue any alert and that there is no record of any occurrence related to the possible earthquake in the state.”


In an email to The Verge, Google spokesperson Ed Fernandez writes:

The Android Earthquake Alerts System is a supplemental service that uses Android phones to quickly estimate earthquake shaking and provide early warnings to users. It’s not designed to replace any official or other public warning systems. On February 14th, our system detected signals from devices near the coast of São Paulo and triggered an earthquake alert to users in the region. We promptly disabled the alerting system in Brazil and are currently investigating what happened. We apologize to our users for the inconvenience and remain committed to improving our tools."

While attending the Munich Security Conference this weekend and on stops in Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the coming days, Rubio will stress that nations in the region should present a new proposal if they have concerns about the US taking over Gaza and displacing its residents, a State Department spokesperson said, declining to be named to outline the US approach.

Rubio will encourage regional leaders to use out of the box thinking and assemble a coalition of partners to present a new plan that brings real change for Palestinians, the spokesperson said, after more than a year of war that leveled much of the Gaza Strip after the Hamas assault on Israel.

“Hopefully they’re going to have a really good plan to present to the president, but right now the only plan — they don’t like it — but the only plan is the Trump plan, so if they’ve got a better plan, you know, now is the time to present it,” Rubio said in a radio interview on Thursday, adding that partner countries must do more than just pay for reconstruction but confront Hamas on the ground, as well.

Trump’s repeated suggestions for Gaza — that the US take ownership of the land, redevelop it into the “Riviera of the Middle East,” move Palestinians to new homes in Egypt and Jordan, and not let them return — has outraged many across the Middle East and beyond. It has been rejected by Arab and Western leaders, with many experts saying it violates international law and amounts to ethnic cleansing.

While Rubio is asserting that Arabs don’t have a plan and that Trump’s new idea is the only one that exists, the region has long wanted to solve the conflict through the establishment of a separate Palestinian state.


The so-called two-state solution was also a cornerstone of the detailed postwar plan for Gaza that Joe Biden’s top diplomat, Antony Blinken, discussed on a dozen trips to the Middle East, with the then-secretary of State saying he would “hand off that plan to the Trump administration to carry forward.”

“The region has put forward a plan, and that’s a two state solution,” said Jennifer Kavanagh, a senior fellow at the Defense Priorities think tank in Washington. “Now that plan is not acceptable to Israel. They’ve made that clear. And for that reason, it’s also kind of a dead issue, it seems, in the United States as well.”

In a meeting with Trump this week, Jordan’s King Abdullah II said he reiterated his country’s “steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank,” calling it “the unified Arab position” and adding that achieving a “just peace on the basis of the two-state solution is the way to ensure regional stability.”

Saudi Arabia, which the US wants to normalize ties with Israel as part of a broadening of the first Trump administration’s Abraham Accords, has also recently emphasized its long-standing commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian state and opposing the displacement of its people is “non-negotiable and not subject to compromise.”

2025-02-14T23:28:49Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/trump-doj-asks-judge-to-toss-case-against-nyc-mayor-eric-adams,"Justice Department lawyers asked a judge to dismiss the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, carrying out an order that several other prosecutors had refused.

The Friday filing in Manhattan federal court capped off a tumultuous week for the Justice Department, which began with Acting US Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordering Manhattan’s chief federal prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon, to drop the Adams case.

Sassoon resigned rather than carry out the directive, and Justice Department officials asked to take over the case also stepped down. In a Wednesday letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, she raised concerns that the decision to drop the case amounted to an improper quid pro quo to get Adams to support President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.

US District Judge Dale Ho must now decide whether to grant the motion. Sassoon said in her letter that she thought it was likely that Ho would conduct a thorough investigation of the Justice Department’s handling of the case and that he might deny the motion as improper.

According to the motion, dismissal of the case against Adams was necessary because it risked interfering in the 2025 mayoral election and was interfering with his ability to govern New York, posing “unacceptable threats to public safety, national security, and related federal immigration initiatives and policies.”


It echoed Bove’s Monday directive to Sassoon, which was widely seen as a challenge to the traditional independence of the US attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, whose prosecutors handle the nation’s highest-profile white-collar crime and political corruption cases.

The lawyers who filed the motion Friday, Antoinette Bacon, a supervisory official in the Justice Department’s criminal division, and Edward Sullivan, a senior litigation counsel in its public integrity section, are both based in Washington.

After Sassoon resigned, Bove reassigned the case to the Justice Department in Washington, but the leaders and several members of the public integrity unit resigned as well. That set off a scramble to find another prosecutor to sign the motion to dismiss before Bacon and Sullivan took on the job.

Adams, 64, was charged in September with accepting illegal campaign donations and taking luxury travel upgrades in exchange for political favors to the Turkish government. The mayor, a Democrat, pleaded not guilty and has argued that he was targeted due to his criticisms of then-President Joe Biden’s immigration policies.

In recent months, Adams had been courting Trump, meeting with the president at his Mar-a-Lago compound, and attending his inauguration. Trump in turn has endorsed Adams’ claims of being politically targeted and previously suggested he might pardon Adams.

In ordering Sassoon to drop the case this week, Bove doubled-down on the suggestion that the case was politically motivated.

Ho could simply sign off on the dismissal, or he could hold a hearing on it and possibly resist it or call for changes to its terms. It is rare for a federal judge to block prosecutors from dropping a case, but the circumstances here are highly unusual.


Sassoon noted that Ho, a Biden appointee who was previously a senior lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, had stressed transparency in the case. She predicted “a lengthy judicial inquiry that is detrimental to the Department’s reputation, regardless of outcome.”

As a possible example, Sassoon pointed to the lengthy inquiry into the first Trump administration’s attempt to drop a case against the president’s former national security advisor, Michael Flynn. The judge in that case refused to dismiss the case and appointed a retired judge to conduct an inquiry into Justice Department’s motives. The case was finally dropped when Trump pardoned Flynn."
2025-02-15T08:44:22Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-02-15/keir-starmer-s-machiavellian-fixer-walks-a-fine-line,"Few recent UK prime ministers stand comparison with either Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair. Thatcher’s drive and governing philosophy haven’t been replicated by any leader since she became Conservative party chief 50 years ago this week. None of Blair’s successors have displayed his intuitive feel for volatile public opinion, nor shared his charisma. Of late, British leaders have hardly seemed up to the job.

T his vacuum has been filled by two Machiavellian political operators who really do have energy and clear strategic goals.

Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s strategist, delivered both Brexit and the Conservative party’s last election victory in 2019. Believing traditional structures were outmoded, his predilection for moving fast and breaking things was more suited to Silicon Valley than government, and he was ousted. Morgan McSweeney, Cummings’ Labour twin and Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, put his boss into No. 10 and aims to keep him there for more than one term. A new Starmer biography, Get In, lets voters in on an open secret — the prime minister’s closest Labour colleagues believe his politics are infinitely malleable — and it’s McSweeney who gives them shape.

An Irish immigrant who learned his politics the hard way, taking on both the extreme right and the militant left in deprived areas of London, McSweeney seeks to reconnect Labour with its traditional working-class voters, many of whom deserted to the Conservatives over Brexit and then moved on to the populism of Nigel Farage and Reform UK after Johnson presided over record immigration. He appears to hate Labour’s “unpatriotic” left-wing faction with a passion.

McSweeney set about destroying the radical socialist Jeremy Corbyn, Starmer’s predecessor as Labour leader, and plotted to purge his followers from the party apparatus. He established a centrist think-tank, Labour Together, as a vehicle to out-organize his enemies, but McSweeney needed a plausible front man for his scheme to take control of the party.

The next Labour leader, according to the authors of Get In, “would need to be known by the members but could not be a Corbynite. At the same time they could not be a rebel. Above all, they couldn’t be honest about their ambition to the incumbent leader until the very moment of release. The uncharismatic Starmer, one of the few mainstream figures who hadn’t resigned in rage from Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, was the ideal candidate.

The rest is history. McSweeney purged his left-wing opponents and even had Corbyn expelled. He crafted Starmer’s lines, had the national anthem sung at party conferences and unfurled the Union flag in Labour’s television broadcasts. Starmer, who had once fought for a second referendum on Brexit, quietly accepted the verdict of the people. The master strategist delivered Starmer a “loveless landslide” victory based on the distribution of votes in key constituencies. In absolute numbers, Labour performed as badly as under Corbyn — but won many more seats when the Tories’ own disillusioned voters gave up on them.

Without McSweeney to guide him, the prime minister has a tendency to lose his way. For a few brief months after the election victory he crafted, McSweeney was temporarily sidelined. A civil servant, Sue Gray, was personally recruited by Starmer to prepare Labour for government and entered No. 10 as his chief of staff. She appears to have been politically guileless. Cabinet ministers were allowed to go their own way and policies were half-baked, often Treasury-driven and very unpopular. Labour cratered in the opinion polls; Gray was duly ousted, replaced by McSweeney.


Will Starmer and McSweeney now live together happily ever after? Some tensions remain unresolved. At times, McSweeney has voiced contempt for middle class idealists, judges, the BBC — the entire liberal establishment. But Starmer, a former human rights lawyer and crown prosecutor, was once a pillar of that establishment.

Among the PM’s personal political friends are Richard Hermer, the attorney general and international law crusader, and Ed Miliband, the climate change and energy secretary and a passionate net-zero enthusiast. The government’s plans to kickstart economic growth will arouse fierce opposition from the green lobby if they include the construction of new airport runways and drilling for North Sea oil and gas. Increasingly harsh measures to deport illegal migrants will also face challenges in the courts. Whose side will Miliband and Hermer be on?

Parallels between the powers behind the throne only go so far. McSweeney is generally a more self-effacing character than Cummings. Nor is Starmer lazy and ill-disciplined like Johnson. Cummings last weekend boasted of bringing down an ungrateful Johnson — “I orchestrated it” — and talks of founding a new political party. He sees Elon Musk as a kindred spirit following the tech titan’s assault on Washington bureaucracy.

Yet McSweeney and Cummings display a common flaw too. Both have failed to understand one important lesson of Machiavelli’s classic work of statecraft, The Prince. A true Machiavellian hides his cunning from friend and foe alike. “Keir acts like an HR manager, not a leader,” the Starmer biography cites McSweeney as saying. By boasting, like Cummings, of his cleverness and his master’s shortcomings, McSweeney may be presuming too much.

2025-02-15T08:48:51Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-15/scholz-calls-for-debt-brake-eu-spending-overhaul-for-defense,"Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned US Vice President JD Vance’s overture to Germany’s far right as a direct intervention in the country’s democracy, marking a new low point in transatlantic relations after Donald Trump’s return to the White House.

Speaking on the same stage at the Munich Security Conference where a day earlier Vance scolded delegates and signaled that German leaders should drop “firewalls” holding the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany out of power, Scholz responded by evoking the country’s Nazi past.

The chancellor said the AfD, whose co-leader Vance subsequently met in Munich, is a party that has trivialized Adolf Hitler’s dictatorship, something that an “overwhelming majority” of German voters reject.

“So we will not accept outsiders intervening in our democracy, in our elections, in the democratic formation of opinions in favor of this party,” Scholz said Saturday, just over a week before Germans go to the polls. “That’s not done — certainly not among friends and allies.”

Vance’s dressing down of leaders at the conference threatened to widen the transatlantic rift as Europeans struggled to grasp what Trump’s second term means for security and ending Russia’s war in Ukraine. The chancellor — who polls show may be ousted from power after next Sunday’s contest — reinforced his call for increased defense spending, made a pitch for loosening of Germany’s borrowing restrictions and an overhaul of European debt rules.

But participants in the three-day conference were left reeling after Vance, in his first major address as vice president, delivered a broadside against European leaders as he waded into domestic politics in favor of surging right-wing movements that are challenging establishment parties across the continent.

The vice president adopted a position embraced by many Trump supporters, portraying efforts to marginalize far-right groups as a way to ignore voters worried about mass migration and suppress democratic processes.

“When I look at Europe today, it’s not clear what happened to some of the Cold War’s winners,” Vance said. Soon after, he met the AfD’s chancellor candidate, Alice Weidel, who has railed against migration into Germany — a position that’s won the support of billionaire Elon Musk.

‘Never Again’
Scholz, who arrived after Vance left the gathering in the Bavarian capital, pushed back hard against the accusations, saying Germany’s post-World War II democracy was a bulwark against the atrocities of its past.

He made reference to Vance’s visit Friday to Dachau outside Munich, the site of a Nazi concentration camp, where the vice president said crimes committed there “should never happen again.”

“This ‘never again’ phrase is the central lesson drawn by Germans after World War II from the horrific experiences of the National Socialist reign of terror,” Scholz said, “and that with great American support.”

Germany’s conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz, who appears poised to take the chancellorship after the ballot and who met with Vance before the speech, called the comments “invasive.”

“We have a different view — and I made that clear to him earlier today,” Merz told broadcaster NTV on Friday.

Scholz used his appearance to reinforce his backing for Ukraine, warning that Trump’s bid to forge a peace with Russian President Vladimir Putin had to take into account Ukraine’s sovereignty. Germany will “never support a dictated peace,” he said.



The chancellor, who has pressed for more defense spending, expressed confidence that the country will have a parliamentary majority to loosen Germany’s debt restrictions, the so-called debt brake. He said it was necessary to push for a broad reform to allow Berlin to continue to meet a NATO benchmark to spend 2% of economic output on defense.

“We need a reform of the debt brake in our constitution directly after the upcoming election,” Scholz said.

Scholz also said that that the European Union’s stability and growth pact should be overhauled to exempt defense spending that exceeds the NATO 2% spending. The rule change would be “temporary” while maintaining fiscal discipline, he said."
2025-02-15T15:32:50Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/613796/nba-tabletop-ar-vision-pro-app-league-pass,"The NBA has introduced a new AR feature for its Vision Pro app this week called Tabletop, which places a floating render of a basketball court in your space during “select” live games, according to an NBA help page describing the feature. On the court, digital avatars mirror the game’s actual players as they move, pass, and shoot — but only for live games that you can watch or listen to with NBA League Pass.

The feature even works for local market games that are otherwise unavailable to stream video of in the app. It was about 45 seconds behind the announcer audio during a local game I tested it with, but Vision Pro owner Justin Ryan reported about a half-second delay after using a toolbar option to sync with the live feed. The feature wasn’t available for any out-of-market games when I tested, so I only had an audio feed to compare with.



Each player has the same avatar (shown as either a robot or with a cell-shaded cartoon style), but you can still differentiate by the color of their jerseys and the names and numbers emblazoned on them. Their name is also placed above their head when they have the ball. The NBA didn’t immediately respond when I asked whether the feature will be available for this weekend’s NBA All-Star events. Here’s a screen recording of the feature from my own Vision Pro, followed by a timestamped link to the same moment from a highlights reel the NBA posted after the game:



The feature is reminiscent of what the Lapz Vision Pro app did for Formula 1 races before it was shut down by F1 itself. If you subscribe to NBA League Pass and have a Vision Pro, look for a new Tabletop button next to the usual “Watch Live” and “Multiview” buttons in the NBA app.


Tabletop was surprisingly polished for an alpha feature when I tried it out. The NBA has shown off mixed reality tech it’s experimenting with in the past, such as the above presentation from NBA commissioner Adam Silver in which he demonstrates using a 3D scan of sports commentator Ahmad Rashad to replace a player in an in-game clip."

From what we’ve seen, and our own Ash Parrish has experienced, Neightrein isn’t so much a sequel to Elden Ring as it is a standalone co-op title set in a parallel universe. It’s got all the visual hallmarks of FromSoftware’s 2022 epic — sweeping vistas, haunting ruins, etc. etc. — along with the brutal boss battles and combat on display in both the original game and its excellent DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree.

The big difference between Nightreign and previous ER titles is that you’re forced to tackle the new region of Limveld over a three-day span, either solo or in a team of three. Then you throw in a few character classes, a leveling system, and a Fortnite-like storm that shrinks the map over time, making each run absolute chaos. If it seems like an amalgamation of multiplayer games, well, it kind of is.

The delay is reportedly at least partly because the updated assistant has issues with giving inaccurate answers to test questions.

An anonymous Amazon employee told the outlet that the upgrade won’t come “until March 31 or later” due to the issues. The new Alexa could be tied to a subscription, with features like “the ability to adopt a personality, recall conversations, order takeout or call a taxi,” and was originally set to launch later this month as a free trial, the Post writes, citing internal documents and messages.

News of the delay comes after months of rumors suggesting Amazon is struggling to realize its plans to “supercharge” Alexa generative AI, which it said in 2023 would take place over a period of months, but still hasn’t. It was reportedly delayed from a late 2024 launch amid beta tester reports of slow, stiff, and less-than-useful responses. Amazon declined to comment on this story.

Apple is also rumored to be having issues with its own Siri AI upgrade, which has been expected to come soon in iOS 18.4, but may see its capabilities limited or delayed entirely to iOS 18.5, coming as early as May, Bloomberg reported yesterday.

Protestors’ messages largely focused on the divisive efforts of Tesla CEO Elon Musk as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency since the start of Donald Trump’s Presidency.

The protests don’t appear to be especially large, but they are numerous, ranging from places like New York to lesser-known locales like Minneapolis, Minnesota suburb Golden Valley. A section of Action Network’s site for organizing protests shows rallies planned for cities in Ohio, Florida, Washington, New Mexico, and Alberta, Canada.Tesla investors have expressed concern that Musk’s activities are negatively impacting the company, which saw its stock price plummet by 21 percent since Trump’s inauguration according to an ABC story this week. Inside the company, employees and senior staff said in a recent meeting that “the company would be better off if Musk resigned,” The Washington Post reported.

One of the larger rallies today was outside of Tesla’s Manhattan showroom, where a previous protest took place on February 9th. In the videos below, people can be heard chanting, “Don’t buy swasticars” and “Elon Musk can go to Mars; we don’t need your Nazi cars,” perhaps referencing Musk’s support for far-right groups like Germany’s AfD party or his suspicious salute on Inauguration Day. More protests are expected, including during the President’s Day holiday on Monday, with one set for Lowell, Maine and at least one other in Richmond, Virginia. Those are in addition to numerous demonstrations planned this weekend that don’t target Tesla showrooms but still relate to the actions of Musk, DOGE, and President Trump more broadly."
2025-02-16T04:34:31Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-16/deepseek-drives-1-3-trillion-china-stock-rally-as-funds-pile-in,"DeepSeek’s breakthrough in artificial intelligence is helping drive a rotation of stock funds back into China from India.

Hedge funds have been piling into Chinese equities at the fastest pace in months as bullishness on the DeepSeek-driven technology rally adds to hopes for more economic stimulus. In contrast, India is suffering a record exodus of cash on concerns over waning macro growth, slowing corporate earnings and expensive stock valuations.

China’s onshore and offshore equity markets have added more than $1.3 trillion in total value in just the past month amid such reallocations, while India’s market has shrunk by more than $720 billion. The MSCI China Index is on track to outperform its Indian counterpart for a third-straight month, the longest such streak in two years.

DeepSeek has shown “that China actually has companies that are forming a vital part of the whole AI ecosystem,” said Ken Wong, an Asian equity portfolio specialist at Eastspring Investments. His firm has been adding Chinese internet holdings over the past few months, while trimming smaller Indian stocks that had “run up way past their valuation multiples.”

The rotation marks an about-face from the pivot into India seen over the past several years, luring funds away from China. That was based on an India’s infrastructure spending splurge and its potential as an alternative manufacturing hub to China. Domestic-focused India has also been seen as a relative haven amid Donald Trump’s tariff plans.

China looks to be regaining its former appeal on a fundamental reevaluation of its investability, especially in tech. After scaring investors with corporate crackdowns not long ago, Beijing may actually help push the new AI theme, as indicated by the news that entrepreneurs including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. co-founder Jack Ma have been invited to meet the nation’s top leaders.

DeepSeek-related developments are likely to help boost China’s economy as well as its markets, providing an extended boost, said Vivek Dhawan, a fund manager at Candriam. “If you put all the pieces together, China becomes more attractive than India in the current set-up on a risk-reward basis.”

The valuation differential adds to China’s allure as well. The MSCI China Index is trading at just 11 times forward earnings estimates, compared with about 21 times for the MSCI India Index.

An analysis of Bloomberg data on regional allocations by some of the largest active Asian equity funds shows most are reducing exposure to Indian equities and adding Chinese stocks in recent months.

While DeepSeek has helped accelerate the flows into China, possible upcoming announcements of further Chinese stimulus remain important as well, according to Andrew Swan, head of Asia ex-Japan equities at Man Group.

“We think policy will now shift toward consumption, and a targeted attempt to encourage the currently high levels of savings to be deployed,” said Swan. The Man Asia Ex-Japan Equity fund he manages increased its China exposure to 40% from 30% in the past year while trimming its India exposure to 18% from 21%.


A complete reversal in fund flows is unlikely, with India stock bulls including Morgan Stanley saying the recent correction may be overdone and the nation’s long-term growth story remains intact.

Meanwhile, the additional 10% tariffs imposed on China by Trump have reinforced Amundi SA’s neutral stance on Chinese equities, according to Asia senior investment strategist Aidan Yao. “While a truce is possible as the two sides converge in trade talks, the external dynamics will remain fluid and challenging for China in the foreseeable future.”

There’s also skepticism among traders who have been burned by failed China rallies in the past. Some have pointed to crowded trading and increasing valuations as reason for caution.

Helen Zhu, chief investment officer at Nan Fung Trinity HK Ltd., sees uncertainty over whether DeepSeek’s AI success can be repeated. “At the end of the day, you don’t really know what the potential monetization opportunities are over the medium to longer term,” she said.

Nonetheless, there’s a palpable buzz of “China’s back” in the markets of late. The positives keep piling up, with Alibaba adding $100 billion in market value over the past five weeks and the Hang Seng Tech Index entering a bull market.

“The DeepSeek news was a well-timed and impactful catalyst that market participants were able to build a case for a reentry” into Chinese markets, said Nicole Wong, a portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management. “From a tactical standpoint, we think it makes sense to be taking advantage of this momentum.”"
2025-02-16T13:26:29Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-16/rise-of-dollar-forwards-builds-risk-for-asia-s-central-banks,"Central banks across Asia are increasingly using derivatives to protect their currencies against a strong dollar, raising questions over how long they can do so and whether they are just storing up trouble for the future.

The Reserve Bank of India’s net dollar short forward position — the amount of dollars that will be sold at a future date for a pre-set price — hit an all-time high of $68 billion in December. Meanwhile Bank Indonesia’s net short book reached $19.6 billion, its highest since at least 2015, show the latest official data.

The swelling forward books point to a shift in strategy among central banks intervening to defend their currencies. But the use of derivatives in addition to spot trades to push back against the dollar is raising concerns about the risk that selling pressure is being deferred rather than removed.

“It’s basically pushing out currency depreciation to a later date and in the meantime, keeping headline reserves high as a way of displaying confidence,” said Dhiraj Nim, a currency strategist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. “I’m a bit worried about that scenario.”

BI and the RBI didn’t immediately respond to Bloomberg’s request for comment. Both institutions have previously confirmed use of derivatives

The Indian rupee and the Indonesian rupiah have been two of Asia’s worst performing currencies over the past 12 months, both losing more than 3.5% of their value against the dollar.

Political Risk
The election of US President Donald Trump has ramped up pressure on emerging-market central banks. Trump’s threats of tariffs have fueled waves of currency depreciation against the dollar, while his willingness to label other countries as currency manipulators has raised the political scrutiny of intervention.

In the wake of Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, a fact sheet circulated detailing his plans, including a call for federal agencies to address currency manipulation by other countries. The designation comes with no immediate penalties but it can rattle financial markets. Trump labeled China a currency manipulator during his first term, while India has previously been on the US watchlist.

Forwards have a number of key advantages for central banks, including potentially lower costs and the fact that they don’t drain the money supply. But they also allow central banks to mask their interventions. The derivatives don’t eat into official reserves, something that may minimize the risk of attracting Trump’s ire. The strategy also allows central banks to keep traders guessing.In the wake of Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, a fact sheet circulated detailing his plans, including a call for federal agencies to address currency manipulation by other countries. The designation comes with no immediate penalties but it can rattle financial markets. Trump labeled China a currency manipulator during his first term, while India has previously been on the US watchlist.

Malaysia has also adopted the strategy of using currency forwards. Its net short forward book was around $27.5 billion by November, after swelling about $4 billion last year. The Philippines reduced its net long forward to just $874 million, the IMF data show.


Bank Negara Malaysia told Bloomberg on Monday that it uses instruments such as foreign exchange swaps and reverse repos to manage onshore market liquidity. The Philippine central bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

On Feb. 11, the Reserve Bank of India was suspected of a heavy intervention to push up the rupee. The currency rose nearly 1%, its biggest gain since November 2022, triggering stop-losses among rupee bears. The central bank intervened across spot and forward markets, traders said.

Dollar Decline
In theory, a recent decline in the dollar offers central banks a reprieve. Trump has canceled or delayed tariffs on Canada, Colombia and Mexico, fueling doubts that he will deliver on his biggest threats. A broad gauge of the dollar has lost roughly 1.7% so far this year.

There are also signs that policymakers are changing tack, with new RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra appearing to adopt a more flexible approach to managing the exchange rate. The RBI has dialed down its bets in the non-deliverable forwards market, according to strategists, and is instead conducting onshore operations in a bid to boost domestic liquidity.

But the advantages of forwards mean the strategy is likely to remain popular among central banks.

“I see very few cons” to using the forward market, said Aaron Hurd, a senior portfolio manager in the currency group at State Street Global Advisors. Central banks need to be careful not build up a forward book that is too large, but right now that isn’t a big worry, he said.

2025-02-17T19:37:06Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/614078/faa-air-traffic-control-spacex-elon-musk-layoff-staff-shortage,"A team from Elon Musk’s SpaceX is visiting the Air Traffic Control Command Center in Virginia Monday to help overhaul the system in the wake of last month’s deadly air disaster in Washington, DC, US Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy announced. The news comes after CNN reported that the Federal Aviation Administration fired hundreds of probationary employees who maintain critical air traffic control infrastructure.

The exact number of workers losing their jobs is unknown, but the union representing them said it was in the “hundreds.” The Trump administration is in the process of trying to eliminate thousands of federal employees as it works with Congressional Republicans on a massive tax cutting bill that is said to favor mostly corporations and the wealthy.



Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, is playing a key role in the mass terminations from his perch at the Department of Government Efficiency. And as critics have noted, Musk’s status as a major government contractor — mostly through his company SpaceX — represents a massive conflict of interest that both he and President Donald Trump have repeatedly attempted to downplay.

In a post on X, Duffy said the team from SpaceX went to Virginia to “get a firsthand look at the current system, learn what air traffic controllers like and dislike about their current tools, and envision how we can make a new, better, modern and safer system.” Previously, Duffy said that Musk’s DOGE team would “plug in” to the FAA to help “upgrade our aviation system.”

Duffy also dismissed criticism about opening the door to a Musk-led team to another sensitive area of the federal government. “Because I know the media (and Hillary Clinton) will claim Elon’s team is getting special access, let me make clear that the @FAANews regularly gives tours of the command center to both media and companies,“ Duffy said. (Clinton has previously criticized the DOGE team’s lack of experience.)

“I know the media (and Hillary Clinton) will claim Elon’s team is getting special access”

The FAA is under heightened scrutiny three weeks after a midair collision over the Potomac River resulted in the deaths of 67 people. The tragedy highlighted shortages of air traffic controllers as well as congestion at major hubs like Ronald Reagan National Airport. The FAA has fielded hundreds of complaints from air traffic workers describing dangerous conditions from staff shortages to dilapidated buildings. And the agency itself lacked a permanent head at the time of the crash — mostly because Musk had a hand in ousting the last administrator after the FAA fined SpaceX for failing to submit safety data.

Duffy’s post doesn’t mention Musk’s role in the ouster, nor the hundreds of workers who were just laid off. CNN says the probationary employees were likely targeted because they’ve been employed for less than a year and lack the right to appeal.

“This draconian action will increase the workload and place new responsibilities on a workforce that is already stretched thin,” David Spero, National President of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, AFL-CIO, said in a statement. “This decision did not consider the staffing needs of the FAA, which is already challenged by understaffing.”

2025-02-18T21:22:11Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/614664/facebook-live-video-30-day-limit-archives,"Facebook will start deleting users’ live broadcast recordings after 30 days starting on February 19th. Users who go live after that date must download the videos to save them from getting deleted before their 30-day expiration period ends. Alternatively, you could share the recordings to your profile as Reels, although that means fitting clips into that format’s 90-second time limit.

Meta says it’s making the change because “most live video views occur within the first few weeks of broadcasting” and to “align our storage policies with industry standards and help ensure we are providing the most up-to-date live video experiences for everyone on Facebook.”

All previously recorded live videos that are older than 30 days will also be removed. However, there will be email and app notifications that go out before your archive is completely deleted. Once you get the notice, you’ll have 90 days to download or transfer the videos. Facebook plans to delete old broadcast recordings in waves over the coming months.


Facebook also has several download tools to help you save your videos, either individually or all at once. Once you get the notification, you can request a bulk download of all your videos within a custom date range. You could also choose to transfer the videos directly to a cloud service like Dropbox or Google Drive.

2025-02-18T22:56:33Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/614861/doge-musk-states-temporary-restraining-order-judge-data,"A US federal judge declined to block Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing or transferring data from seven government agencies, or stop further firings of their workforce.

DC District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan denied a temporary restraining order (TRO) sought by a group of 14 Democratic state attorneys general, led by New Mexico. The states had argued that Musk and DOGE have acted to trim the federal workforce, agency projects, and gain unprecedented data access without the proper authority. The Trump administration told the court that Musk is actually not an employee nor administrator of DOGE at all — he is instead an employee of the separate White House Office and advisor to the president. Chutkan found the states couldn’t meet the high standard for the emergency block by showing that they’d be irreparably harmed unless she stopped DOGE. It’s not enough to posit the mere possibility that the group would take “take actions that irreparably harm” the states, she says.

Still, Chutkan seems open to aspects of the states’ case. The AGs “raise a colorable Appointments Clause claim with serious implications. Musk has not been nominated by the President nor confirmed by the U.S. Senate, as constitutionally required for officers who exercise ‘significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States,’” she writes. “Accepting Plaintiffs’ allegations as true, Defendants’ actions are thus precisely the ‘Executive abuses’ that the Appointments Clause seeks to prevent.” Chutkan also admonishes the Trump administration counsel in a footnote where she suggests an official’s sworn declaration characterizing the authority that Trump’s executive order creating DOGE “contemplates” appears to contradict the plain text of the order. “Defense counsel is reminded of their duty to make truthful representations to the court,” she writes.


The states still have the opportunity to pursue the case on the merits, and file for a preliminary injunction. That would provide a new opportunity to seek to stop Musk and DOGE’s access to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), and Transportation.

“While we are disappointed that the court declined to issue a temporary restraining order, we remain committed to putting an end to Elon Musk’s unlawful power grab,” New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez says in a statement. “Every day that he is allowed to operate without a congressional mandate and with little apparent supervision, Musk is destabilizing our government and disrupting critical funding for education, public health and national security. His move fast and break things mentality is not only reckless, but also unconstitutional, and we are prepared to pursue this case for as long as it takes to bring this chaos to an end.”"

AI Pins that have already been purchased will continue to function normally until 3PM ET on February 28th, Humane says in a support document. After that date, Pins will “no longer connect to Humane’s servers.” As a result, AI Pin features will “no longer include calling, messaging, AI queries / responses, or cloud access.” Humane is also encouraging users to download any pictures, videos, and notes stored on their Pins before they are permanently deleted at that shutdown time.

Humane AI Pin review: not even close
After the shutdown, offline features like “battery level” will still work, Humane says, but “any function that requires cloud connectivity like voice interactions, AI responses, and .Center access” will not.

Humane will only offer refunds on AI Pins that are “within the 90-day return window from their original shipment date,” according to an FAQ about the shutdown. Refunds “must be submitted by February 27th, 2025.” If you have paid for a Humane subscription past February 28th, Humane says “..we will process a prorated refund.”

Anyone who had been waiting for a replacement charging case following its recall will “automatically receive a refund for the portion of your original purchase price that was allocated to the Charge Case after February 28, 2025.”

HP is buying Humane’s CosmOS, bringing on Humane technical staff, and will get more than 300 patents and patent applications, Humane says in its press release.

Ahead of the AI Pin’s official launch, Humane hyped up the device with an onstage demo at TED that left us with a lot of questions and a reveal video that it had to update to address a big error. The Pin finally launched in April 2024 to scathing reviews; The Verge’s David Pierce said that “it just doesn’t work,” and MKBHD called it “the worst product I’ve ever reviewed.”

Humane reportedly started looking for a buyer shortly after the launch of the AI Pin at a price as high as $1 billion — a lot more than the $116 million acquisition price announced today. And the AI Pin appears to have sold quite poorly, with The Verge reporting in August that daily returns were outpacing sales. Humane cut the price of the Pin in October.

2025-02-19T21:24:22Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/615869/volvo-es90-sedan-nvidia-drive-agx-orin,"Volvo’s next electric vehicle, the ES90 midsized luxury sedan, sounds like its got some serious computing chops.

The new EV will come with a dual Nvidia Drive AGX Orin configuration, making it the “most powerful car Volvo ever created in terms of core computing capacity,” the company claims today. The new supercomputer is included as part of a single tech stack called Superset, which Volvo says will underpin all of its next-gen vehicles going forward.

The ES90 will be Volvo’s first vehicle to come with the Nvidia’s system-on-a-chip, enabling it to perform core functions at lightning fast speeds thanks to the computer’s abilities to perform 508 trillion operations per second (TOPS). This will come handy when managing functionalities such as “AI-based, state-of-the-art active safety features, car sensors and efficient battery management.”

508 trillion operations per second

Orin system also represents an “eightfold” improvement in processing speeds over the San Jose-based chipmaker’s Xavier computer that featured in the 2018 announcement of a team-up between Volvo and Nvidia on in-car hardware. The increased processing power to enable Volvo to gradually enhance its deep learning model and neural network “from 40 million to 200 million parameters,” the company says.

The ES90 will be built on Volvo’s SPA2 architecture and will be the second vehicle, after the EX90, to be based on its Superset tech stack. Superset is a modular engineering platform that the company says will be used to make safer cars, more efficiently, and to improve them over time through over-the-air software updates.

Tesla was the first company to introduce the idea of a connected vehicle with updateable software that could improve over timne. Now, the rest of the industry is scrambling to catch up by introducing their own upgradable vehicles. Volvo’s EX90 was intended to be the first major effort, but the electric SUV was delayed by software troubles, and when it eventually arrived it lacked many of its promised features.

Volvo says it envisions a future in which features such as driver assist technology and battery range are able to be improved over time thanks to this new tech stack. And improvements for the EX90 will be translatable to the ES90, and vice versa.

“The Volvo ES90 is one of the most technically advanced cars on the market today and is designed to be improved further with time,” says Anders Bell, Volvo’s chief engineering and technology officer, in a statement. “Built on our state-of-the-art Superset tech stack, the ES90 puts safety at the forefront.”"

The company’s just announced a way for Nvidia fans to sign up for “Verified Priority Access” to buy the elusive two-slot SFF-friendly RTX 5090 and 5080 Founders Edition graphics cards.

Like a similar Verified Priority Access program for the RTX 4090, the new program is invite-only, but this time you’ll apply for access by filling out this form rather than being pre-selected. The site will check that you’ve already had an Nvidia account (accounts created after January 30th need not apply) and ask you whether you’d prefer a 5090 or a 5080. Then, it’ll apparently use an algorithm to figure out if you’re a real gamer (analyzing your Nvidia app / GeForce Experience use) before offering a card. Limit one per person.


“Invites will begin rolling out next week,” writes Nvidia. The company doesn’t say how many cards have been allocated to this program, so it’s difficult to tell if this is a meaningful way to get cards to gamers rather than scalpers."

The company published a blog post and video today showing off a “generalist Android agent,” slowly controlling apps on a tablet in much the same way that Rabbit claimed its R1 device would over a year ago. (It couldn’t, and can’t.) The work builds on LAM Playground, a “generalist web agent” Rabbit launched last year.

The engineers don’t use the Rabbit R1 at all for the demonstration. Instead, they type their requests into a prompt box on a laptop, which translates them to actions on an Android tablet. They task it with things like finding a YouTube video or locating a whiskey cocktail recipe in a cocktail app, gathering the ingredients, and then adding them to a Google Keep grocery list. At one point, they ask it to download the puzzle game 2048 and figure out how to play it, which it does, albeit slowly.



The model generally does the things they ask, sometimes well and sometimes with quirks like sending a poem over WhatsApp one message at a time instead of in a single block. One of the engineers wonders if they should have asked it to use line breaks in their prompt, but they don’t go back to try again.

Rabbit’s AI agent is clearly still a work in progress, as it has been since the R1 launched with almost none of the capabilities that founder and CEO Jesse Lyu presented in January 2024. Rabbit has steadily rolled out updates, like the ability to train its AI agents to complete specific tasks or prompt it to remake its own interface. The examples it presented today are “only the core action loop an Android agent completes,” according to Rabbit’s blog post. The company promises to share more about its “upcoming cross-platform multi-agent system” in coming weeks."

Asked if he plans to audit the Federal Reserve, Musk said yes without offering elaboration. He also added fuel to the possibility of giving payouts to the public from some of the budget savings that DOGE identifies. Trump said Wednesday that he was weighing the idea.

“It’s money that’s taken away from things that are destructive to the country and organizations that hate you, [and given] to you…The spoils of battle, you know,” said the Tesla CEO before a supportive crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference, without identifying any organization. CPAC is a decades-old, annual gathering of conservatives that in recent years has become a celebration of Trump and his Make America Great Again movement.

The billionaire also said that he would be looking into whether there is gold in Fort Knox, the depository in Kentucky for U.S. gold reserves, an idea that was raised a day earlier by Trump. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg on Thursday that there is an audit every year and that “all the gold is there.” 

Musk made a theatrical entrance on the CPAC stage, dressed in black, wearing sunglasses and a black MAGA hat and pumping his fists in the air. In a surprise gesture, he was then joined by President Javier Milei of Argentina, who presented Musk with a symbol of Milei’s own efforts to shred what he calls wasteful spending in his own government: a chain saw.

Musk held up the power tool and said: “This is the chain saw for bureaucracy.”

Musk didn’t explain his plans for looking at Fed operations during the onstage interview by Rob Schmitt of Newsmax, a conservative news and opinion cable channel. The Federal Reserve has its financials audited every year, and it publishes them online.

Musk, who backed Trump financially during the presidential campaign, had recently written on his X platform that “all aspects of the government must be fully transparent and accountable to the people. No exceptions, including, if not especially, the Federal Reserve.”

Asked how much waste he could find in the federal budget, Musk said, “It’s like being in a room…and the walls, the roof and the floor are all targets. So, it’s like, you’re going to close your eyes and shoot in any direction.”

DOGE says its cost cutting has amassed $55 billion in estimated savings as of Feb. 17 through contract and lease renegotiations, grant cancellations, asset sales, workforce reductions, regulatory savings and fraud detection. Critics have said some of his efforts run afoul of laws that say the president can’t refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress or fire officials whose terms of service are set by Congress.

2025-02-20T05:11:45Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-19/microsoft-unveils-quantum-computing-chip-for-future-data-centers,"Microsoft Corp. announced its first quantum computing chip, a major step in the company’s effort to produce devices that might someday solve problems beyond the reach of modern computers.

The company says its Majorana 1 chip harnesses 8 qubits, the building blocks of quantum computing, on a sticky-note-sized piece of hardware it figures could eventually host 1 million of them. Right now, the chip is capable of little more than solving math problems that prove it can be controlled. But Microsoft engineers say it’s far enough along to serve as the foundation for future quantum machines.

Microsoft’s announcement indicates that its engineers have found a way to deploy the particles that make quantum computing possible in a system that might one day power data centers and enable advances in fields like chemistry and health care. Some of the findings, outlining the operation of what the company calls a topoconductor, are being published Wednesday in the journal Nature.

“Scientists actually theorized this in 1937,” said Jason Zander, a Microsoft executive vice president charged with bringing quantum and other promising technologies to market. “It’s taken us nearly a hundred years to prove it. Now we can harness it.” He added that quantum machines will be doing useful things in “years, not decades.”


The field of quantum computing, whose imminent arrival has been predicted for about a decade, has seen a flurry of announcements in recent months indicating that the machines may be nearing practical utility.

The technology marks a departure from the foundational structure of computers. Whether it’s an iPhone or a supercomputer in a data center, all computers process information in units called bits, which are encoded as either a one or a zero. Quantum bits – or qubits – represent probabilities of a one or a zero, at times appearing as both.

Owing to that pliability, strings of qubits can consider several possibilities at once, enabling them to find solutions to problems that befuddle traditional machines firmly tethered to ones and zeroes. Alphabet Inc.’s Google in December announced that its own new quantum chip took five minutes to reason through a problem that would take traditional computers longer to solve than the universe’s age.


The trouble – for Google, Microsoft and a host of startups plugging away at quantum machines — is the technology’s error rate. Producing the particles that can be electronically controlled requires supercooled, quiet environments because stray heat or sound waves can introduce mistakes. In experiments, these particles blink in and out of existence in a fraction of a second. And correcting their errors can be as big a challenge as creating the particles.

Microsoft, which started its quantum work in 2004, took a different approach than most by focusing its efforts on minimizing errors — specifically on Majorana, quasiparticles named for the Italian physicist who theorized them in the 1930s. Microsoft believes Majorana qubits will prove less prone to inadvertent flips between ones and zeros than qubits created by other approaches.


To isolate and control Majorana, Microsoft cobbled together, atom-by-atom, strips of indium-arsenide, and joined aluminum nanowires together in an H shape. When cooled to near absolute zero and precisely tuned with a magnetic field, Majorana are induced at each of the letter’s four ends, making a single qubit. It gives off signals — the ones and zeroes — that engineers can read with microwaves. That structure can be repeated across a chip.

There were some false starts: Microsoft researchers thought they’d identified the particles in 2018, but later retracted the paper that sought to prove it. Eventually they cracked the problem and managed to create and measure Majorana a few years later."

2025-02-20T21:50:21Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/616967/rivian-earnings-q4-2024-profit-loss-ev,"Rivian announced a significant milestone today, reporting its first “positive gross profit” in its fourth quarter earnings for 2024. It was a sign that the struggling company’s efforts to slash costs through the gut overhaul of its R1 electric vehicles is starting to yield some positive results. But dark clouds loom ahead, as the company said it expects to sell fewer vehicles in 2025 than last year.

Rivian reported $170 million in positive gross profits, which includes production and sales but does not factor in other expenses, for the three-month period that ended December 31, 2024. That was based on $1.7 billion in revenues. The company said its net loss for the fourth quarter was $743 million, as compared to $1.5 billion in net losses in the same period in 2023.

Rivian earned $4.5 billion in revenue for the full year 2024, based on the delivery of 51,579 vehicles. It record a net loss of $4.7 billion, compared to $5.4 billion in 2023. Rivian cited increased revenue from the sale of regulatory credits to other automakers, which is also a primary revenue driver for Tesla. The company said it saw a $260 million increase in regulatory credit sales in the fourth quarter year over year.


It record a net loss of $4.7 billion, compared to $5.4 billion in 2023.

“Our variable cost reductions were driven by the launch of our second generation R1 vehicles, which included significant engineering design optimizations, supply chain driven cost reductions, and improvement in commodity costs,” the company said in a note to shareholders.

For the year ahead, Rivian said it expects to sell 46,000-51,000 vehicles, citing “changes to government policies and regulations, and a challenging demand environment.” Despite this, the company says it expects to achieve “modest gross profit” for the full year.

“While uncertainties persist, we remain focused on executing against our key value drivers and are confident in electrifying the world in the long term,” Rivian said. “Our guidance represents management’s current view on potential adjustments to incentives, regulations, and tariff structures.”

The company recently announced plans to open up sales of its electric delivery van to any commercial fleet owner. And it unveiled its first special edition R1 vehicle for soft sand off-roading.

Rivian is certainly facing tougher months ahead, with the Trump administration promising to apply tariffs to a range of auto parts, as well as rolling back Biden-era EV incentives. On the plus side, the company has a $5.8 billion joint venture with Volkswagen on software and vehicle development."
2025-02-20T22:16:24Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/616719/fitbit-versa-3-sense-overheating-battery-wearables,"
Last month, Fitbit Versa 3 and Sense owners started getting notifications to download a mandatory firmware update. The problem? Overheating batteries. In an official consumer notice, Google (which owns Fitbit) notes that the firmware update would “reduce the risk of battery overheating and reduce battery capacity.” Affected users, of which Google says there is a “limited number,” were also eligible to apply for a $50 credit.

Technically, fixing this kind of problem is a good thing. You don’t want batteries to overheat and burn a customer — and the official notice also notes that this issue doesn’t impact all Versa 3 or Sense devices. However, affected users have reported on Fitbit’s forums and subreddit that the update dramatically reduced their devices’ battery life.

Multiple users have complained that devices that used to last anywhere between 2-6 days now barely last a single day after updating to the new firmware. Some have said the reduction has now made their devices useless. Others are upset that Fitbit is only offering $50 as an appeasement.

Fitbit recalls Ionic smartwatch after 78 reports of burns
In its notice, Google does note that the firmware update will result in the battery lasting “for shorter periods between charges and [users] may need to charge [their] devices more frequently.” However, to smartwatch users, there’s a big difference between charging more frequently and charging daily. Many people who opt for Fitbits do so precisely because the brand’s smartwatches are known to last longer than a single day. The Verge reached out to Google for further details, but the company declined to add any additional commentary beyond the official notice.

It’d be one thing if this was a rare one-off. However, Fitbit was just fined $12 million after its Ionic watches’ batteries overheated and burned 78 users. And while it’s unrelated to overheating wearables, it certainly doesn’t help that Google recently issued a similar firmware update capping battery performance tied to a $100 credit for its Pixel 4A phones.

Skip in 5s





Meanwhile, a lawsuit filed in 2022 alleges that Fitbit’s problem wasn’t limited to the Ionic. The plaintiffs claimed the issue also impacted the Versa Lite and a Versa 2. The lawsuit also included photos of burns that people said came from their Fitbit Blaze, Inspire, Inspire 2, Sense, and Versa 3 devices. The latest firmware update seems to validate that battery overheating at least was a problem with the Versa 3 and Sense.

These sorts of battery complaints with Fitbits aren’t new. Peruse the r/Fitbit subreddit, and you’ll find years’ worth of Fitbit owners questioning if their devices are burning them or just causing skin irritation. There are also numerous threads of users pondering sudden, rapid battery drain. Almost all these threads also highlight difficult experiences with customer support. In other words, this most recent case just underscores how this has been a problem for quite some time — an issue exacerbated for longtime Fitbit users by a messy transition period since Google acquired Fitbit."
2025-02-20T22:33:06Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/616662/carbon-removal-dac-oil-gas-occidental,"Occidental, the oil giant that has tried to fashion itself as a climate tech leader, is being real clear now about capturing carbon dioxide emissions, which it sees as the next big thing for fossil fuel production.

That shouldn’t be surprising coming from a petroleum company. But Occidental has built up an entire arm of its business purporting to fight climate change. It acquired the startup Carbon Engineering, a pioneer in the development of technologies that filter CO2 out of the air, back in 2023. Occidental subsidiary 1PointFive is building giant facilities in Texas using Carbon Engineering’s tech. Those projects got support from the Biden administration and from big companies, including Amazon and Microsoft, with their own climate goals to meet. Sucking carbon dioxide out of the air is supposed to get rid of the pollution causing climate change.

But that strategy, called direct air capture (DAC), doesn’t get at the root of the problem: extracting and burning fossil fuels is what produces that planet-heating pollution in the first place. What happens to that carbon once it’s captured is an even hairier question. DAC is sold as a climate solution because the captured carbon can be sequestered underground, keeping the greenhouse gas from building up in the atmosphere and raising global average temperatures.

“We believe the next round of technology that’s going to add significant barrels — 50 to 70 billion barrels of reserves — will be production that comes from the use of CO2 in enhanced oil recovery.”

But fossil fuel companies have historically used CO2 in a process called enhanced oil recovery, shooting carbon into depleting oil fields to force out hard-to-reach reserves. In an earnings call this week, Occidental described its DAC business as imperative to the company’s ability to produce more oil.

“We believe the next round of technology that’s going to add significant barrels — 50 to 70 billion barrels of reserves — will be production that comes from the use of CO2 in enhanced oil recovery,” Occidental president and CEO Vicki Hollub said on the call. This was in response to a question about how the company was thinking about its carbon-removal business with the change in administration this year — from one that prioritized action on climate change under Joe Biden to one that aims to “drill, baby, drill” under Donald Trump.

Hollub essentially characterized the use of captured carbon for enhanced oil recovery as the biggest boon for fossil fuels since fracking enabled the US shale revolution. “Taking CO2 out of the atmosphere is a technology that needs to work for the United States, and President Trump knows the business case for this,” Hollub said, adding that she’s had “several conversations” with Trump.

Occidental’s seen a slight slump in its enhanced oil production over the past few years, but company leadership thinks it can turn that around with the help of captured CO2. “There’s not enough organic CO2 in the country to be able to flood all the things that we’re going to need to flood to get that 50 to 70 billion barrels,” according to Hollub.

Direct air capture is still a prohibitively expensive endeavor, however, costing hundreds of dollars per ton of CO2 captured. Its future in the US could hinge on whether the Trump administration keeps Biden-era tax credits for the technology, which Hollub mentioned on the call. After all, the company doesn’t want to risk its DAC plants becoming stranded assets. Its first large DAC plant, called Stratos, is slated to come online this year in Texas, and the company has plans for an even bigger project at King Ranch that was awarded federal funding in 2023.

Microsoft struck a deal with 1PointFive last year for 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide removal. And Amazon agreed to pay for 250,000 metric tons of carbon removal from 1PointFive’s first forthcoming DAC plant. Both of those agreements, at least, include stipulations that the captured carbon be permanently sequestered without being used to produce more oil and gas.

But there’s another worrisome outcome with these kinds of deals. The DAC plants Occidental is building have to succeed for that CO2 to be sequestered. Other companies that purchase carbon-removal services budget that into their carbon accounting to meet their own climate goals. Time and money that could have been spent reducing greenhouse gas emissions by other means — say, by switching to cleaner energy sources — could be squandered on carbon-removal technologies that might never become commercially viable.

Occidental will still have its fossil fuel business to fall back on, even if DAC fails, however. And for now, it can profit off its oil and gas business, profit from cleaning up some of the CO2 pollution it creates, and then use the pollution it captures to produce even more fossil fuels."

The GSA currently operates several hundred EV chargers across the country, with approximately 8,000 plugs that are available for government-owned EVs as well as federal employees’ personally owned vehicles.

The official guidance instructing federal workers to begin the process of shutting down the chargers will be announced internally next week, according to a source with knowledge of the plans. Some regional offices have been told to start taking their chargers offline, according to an email viewed by The Verge.

“As GSA has worked to align with the current administration, we have received direction that all GSA owned charging stations are not mission critical,” the email reads.

The GSA is working on the timing of canceling current network contracts that keep the EV chargers operational. Once those contracts are canceled, the stations will be taken out of service and “turned off at the breaker,” the email reads. Other chargers will be turned off starting next week.

“Neither Government Owned Vehicles nor Privately Owned Vehicles will be able to charge at these charging stations once they’re out of service,” it concludes.

At the GSA’s Denver office, employees were told that EV chargers at four federally owned buildings would be taken offline next week. The news was first reported by Colorado Public Radio.

RelatedTrump’s war on electric cars has only just begun
Under the Biden administration, the GSA was in charge of implementing the president’s plan to phase out the federal government’s use of gas-powered vehicles in favor of EVs. The federal government owns approximately 650,000 vehicles, more than half of which were to be replaced with EVs.

Those new EVs would need reliable places to charge. Former President Joe Biden’s signature climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, included $975 million for the GSA to upgrade federal buildings across the country with “emerging and sustainable technologies.” The aim was to achieve a net-zero emissions federal building portfolio by 2045, which included EV chargers.

According to a March 2024 update, the GSA had ordered over 58,000 EVs and begun installing more than 25,000 charging ports, adding to the 8,000 already in use across the government. An interactive map showing the location of all GSA-owned chargers has been taken offline as of February this year. (An older version is available through the Wayback Machine.)

The GSA will also begin offloading the EVs it purchased under the Biden administration, the source said. It’s unclear whether those vehicles will be sold or simply put away in storage. It’s also unclear whether other federal agencies will be making similar decisions for their own EVs, although many of those agencies tend to use the GSA’s EV chargers for their own plug-in vehicles.

“Neither Government Owned Vehicles nor Privately Owned Vehicles will be able to charge at these charging stations once they’re out of service.”

President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to roll back his predecessor’s EV policies, which he falsely labeled a “mandate.” And since his inauguration, he halted a $5 billion program to install new public EV chargers across the country, signed an executive order rescinding Biden’s directives to purchase new EVs for the federal government’s vehicle fleet, and signaled his intention to eliminate the federal EV tax credit and other incentives for consumers.

Unlike gas-powered vehicles, EVs generate no tailpipe pollution. Burning fossil fuels like gasoline and diesel release carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the environment. These emissions have been proven to cause climate change, which supercharges extreme weather events like wildfires, hurricanes, and flooding. Transportation, including personal vehicle usage, accounts for about 28 percent of all US greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

A spokesperson for the GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The GSA also plans on selling approximately 500 buildings as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to gut the federal government, Wired reports."
2025-02-22T06:31:35Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-22/trump-proposes-new-ship-fees-to-challenge-china-s-maritime-might,"The Trump administration is proposing fees on the use of China’s commercial ships it says could help counter the country’s maritime dominance.

The Office of the US Trade Representative outlined a plan for fees on Chinese-built ships that transport traded goods as well as mandates requiring a portion of US products to be moved on American vessels.

The proposal, announced on Friday, springs from a trade investigation into China’s practices in the maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries that began under the Biden administration and concluded with a report just four days before President Donald Trump took office. The US inquiry concluded that Beijing was unfairly dominating the sectors and said “urgent action” was needed to address the issue.

If adopted, however, the proposed fees could translate to additional costs for American consumers, since higher shipping costs could be passed on in the form of higher prices. It’s also not clear that the proposals would be enough to restore American shipbuilding capacity, which has eroded despite century-old protections meant to encourage the use of US-built and -operated vessels.


While the US churns out its own steady supply of warships and Europe leads the world in building cruise ships, global merchant shipbuilding is dominated by three Asian countries: China, South Korea and Japan, which together account for well over 90% of commercial shipbuilding.

China has targeted the maritime, shipbuilding and logistics sectors for dominance, effectively undercutting competition and winning “market share with dramatic effect,” the Office of the US Trade Representative said in its proposal Friday.

Read More: Trump Gets New Tool to Fight China With Findings on Shipbuilding

China’s market share has grown from less than 5% of global tonnage in 1999 to more than 50% in 2023. China owned 19% of the commercial world fleet as of January last year, and it controls production of 95% of shipping containers, the office said.

Higher costs for shipping on Chinese vessels could present an opportunity for shipbuilders in South Korea and Japan.

Katherine Tai, who served as Joe Biden’s trade representative, last month said the US ranks 19th in the world in commercial shipbuilding, with a volume of less than five ships being built each year. China, in comparison, builds more than 1,700 per year, she added.

China’s dominance in the industry can be partly traced to low pricing and labor standards as well as artificially low labor costs that undercut competition, the Biden administration said.

The resulting overreliance on Chinese supplies creates economic security risks tied to potential disruption, the trade office said.

The remedies proposed Friday, which would be imposed under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, are now subject to public comment and review, including during a public hearing scheduled for next month.

The US trade representative is proposing several service fees — including a levy of as much as $1 million — to be charged when Chinese-built vessels enter a US port.

The administration is also proposing steadily escalating restrictions on maritime transport of all US goods. Initially at least 1% of American products exported by maritime vessels would have to be carried on vessels that are both US-flagged and -operated. The requirements would steadily rise, with the threshold climbing to 15% after seven years and eventually encompassing requirements the ships be built in the US too.


The mandate would effectively expand longstanding requirements meant to encourage the construction and use of American ships. Under a federal law known as the Jones Act, US-built, -registered and -crewed ships are required when moving goods between US ports.

The trade office is seeking to meet a statutory deadline to announce remedies in the probe even as Trump’s nominee for USTR, Jamieson Greer, has yet to be confirmed.

Trump started his second term opening new fronts in trade wars, beginning with Canada and Mexico, though ultimately holding off on duties for those North American partners while announcing a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods over Beijing’s failure to stop the fentanyl trade.

Trump has also threatened tariffs on a range of sectors, including automobiles, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and lumber by early April.

The commercial shipping sector is viewed as a major leverage point China could exploit given the global trading system’s dependence on its vessels. Any disruptions to that system, accidental or not, could lead to supply chain shocks that the US wants to avert.

Asus has now announced details about a “Fragrance Mouse” to go with it. Mentioned along with the company’s Copilot Plus PCs at CES 2025, it’s coming to the US “around late April, early May,” company spokesperson Anthony Spence told The Verge in an email.

The Fragrance Mouse has a light-duty mousing layout of two buttons and a scroll wheel. Its trick is on the underside, where a small compartment holds a refillable vial you can load with essential oils of your choosing. It’s an otherwise standard affair — the mouse connects wirelessly over Bluetooth or a 2.4GHz wireless USB dongle, offers adjustable DPI (1200dpi, 1600dpi, and 2400dpi), and is powered by a single AA battery. Asus says it’s “available in distinctive Iridescent White or Rose Clay finishes.”

You may not be able to get a complete stinky laptop and mouse set, since the Adol 14 Air Fragrance Edition has only been released in China since being introduced in July 2024, as Ars Technica notes. Spence was unable to confirm pricing details for the Fragrance Mouse in his email to The Verge"
2025-02-22T16:51:51Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/617928/att-will-let-you-split-your-bill-with-people-on-your-plan,"AT&T has introduced SplitPay, a new payment option that lets those sharing a phone plan with others split their payment line-by-line, so no one person has to pay the entire bill. The company says the program is available for “select postpaid wireless plans,” and that those using SplitPay can still get multi-line discounts.

It sounds like a nice idea, especially if you’ve ever had the experience of bothering people you’re sharing a plan with for their part of a bill that you pay. As for what happens if not everyone pays up, AT&T says the account holder is still responsible for the bill, and late payments could still result in extra fees or suspended service. The company writes that it will text each payer a payment link and what they owe when a billing cycle begins, and says it will notify the primary payer about any outstanding payments prior to the bill’s due date.

As spotted by 9to5Mac, Smart Home Centre confirmed the functionality using a Switchbot S10, which offers its own beta support for Matter. (Switchbot first added Matter robot vacuum support last year, but it required a hub and was kind of a hack.) Apple Home screenshots shared in the story show the robot vacuum’s Home widget (complete with a little robot vacuum glyph) along with a control screen featuring a start / stop button, options for choosing between “Vacuum” and “Vacuum and Mop,” selections for operating modes like “Quiet” or “Deep Clean.” There’s also a “Send to Dock” option, although Smart Home Centre notes that this only paused the S10.

Robot vacuums in the new iOS beta can also be added to automations and scenes. You can see how all of it works in the outlet’s video below.



Apple was expected to add Matter support for robot vacuum cleaners last year, but that didn’t materialize. Few robot vacuum companies offer Matter support at the moment, and some of those are still waiting on a firmware update to enable it. Robot vacuum makers have confirmed to us that these models will support Matter:

Ecovacs X8 Pro Omni
Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo
Switchbot S20
Switchbot S10
Switchbot K10 Pro Plus
Switchbot K10 Plus
Dreame X50 Ultra
Dreame X40 Ultra
Roborock Saros 10 and 10R
Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra
Roomba Combo 10
Some of the other changes users have spotted in the first developer beta for iOS 18.4 include the addition of an ambient music Control Center option, a new “sketch” style option in Image Playground, Apple Intelligence-powered Priority Notifications, and the ability to set a default translation app. More changes could be coming, as this is only the first beta for a release that had been expected to begin Siri’s big upgrade, a shift that may still be more than a month away."

With the slim laptops’ spec bump, the MacBook line’s M4 transition will be complete.

Gurman didn’t provide timing beyond that the laptops are coming next month, but as usual before it launches a product, Apple is “preparing its marketing, sales and retail teams for the debut” and letting its retail stock of the laptops clear out. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch models are expected to come at the same time, like last year.

RelatedApple is preparing an M4 MacBook Air update for early next year

Since the Apple Silicon transition, the MacBook Airs have largely shared specs with the low-end MacBook Pro, just packed into a slimmer laptop with omissions like fewer ports and no cooling fan. The base model 14-inch Pro starts with 10-core CPUs and 10-core GPUs and feature 16GB of RAM — you can get a sense of that configuration’s performance from our review of the base M4 MacBook Pro. Ideally, the new Air models will also get the Pro’s key upgrade of being able to simultaneously connect to two external displays with the lid open.

That leaves only the Mac Studio and Mac Pro, which are still M2-generation machines, without M4 chips. Gurman has pegged the Mac Studio’s M4 bump for “between March and June” and the Mac Pro’s anywhere from June to this fall."

However, the message lacked a detail from Musk’s tweet, according to the Times, where he said, “Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation,” which a number of lawyers have said would be illegal. The Washington Post reports that experts said it “may be asking some recipients to violate federal laws,” and Sam Bagenstos, a University of Michigan law professor quoted by the Times, said, “There is zero basis in the civil service system for this.”

House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement Sunday that “Elon Musk is traumatizing hardworking federal employees, their children and families. He has no legal authority to make his latest demands.”

The stunt is another echo of Musk’s approach after he took over Twitter, with requests to review engineer’s code and saying that failing to respond to an email would be regarded as a resignation. Across hundreds of tweets posted on Saturday and early Sunday, Musk — who may or may not run the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), in addition to his various companies — claimed, without presenting evidence, to be rooting out fraud and employees who don’t do any work.

Leaders of at least some of the departments, like the FBI and State Department, reportedly told their workers to await guidance to respond, while the Post reports that acting Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Bridget Bean told staff to comply with the “valid request.”

Unions like the American Federation of Government Employees and the National Treasury Employees Union told employees “not to respond, either just yet or at all,” Axios writes.

Space.com notes that the “one other glimpse” of the plane in space was while it was “deploying from Falcon Heavy’s upper stage” during its December 2023 launch.

The Space Force says it snapped the photo during experimental “first-of-kind” aerobraking maneuvers “to safely change its orbit using minimal fuel.” The Air Force said in October this would involve “a series of passes using the drag of Earth’s atmosphere,” and that once complete, it would resume its other experiments before de-orbiting.



This is the X-37B’s seventh mission; its sixth, which concluded in November 2022, lasted about two-and-a-half years (or 908 days) and was its longest mission to date. Prior to its launch, the Space Force described mission goals that included “operating in new orbital regimes” and testing ”future space domain awareness technologies.“ It also mentioned an onboard NASA experiment involving plant seeds’ radiation exposure during long spaceflight missions."

After Grok users noticed that the chatbot had been given instructions to not respond with those results, Babuschkin blamed an unnamed, ex-OpenAI employee at xAI for updating Grok’s system prompt without approval.

In response to questions on X, Babuschkin said that Grok’s system prompt (the internal rules that govern how an AI responds to queries) is publicly visible “because we believe users should be able to see what it is we’re asking Grok.” He said “an employee pushed the change” to the system prompt “because they thought it would help, but this is obviously not in line with our values.”


Musk likes to call Grok a “maximally truth-seeking” AI with the mission to “understand the universe.” Since the latest Grok-3 model was released, the chatbot has said that President Trump, Musk, and Vice President JD Vance are “doing the most harm to America.” Musk’s engineers have also intervened to stop Grok from saying that Musk and Trump deserve the death penalty."

Smaller print makes clear one of America’s biggest manufacturing successes is mostly imported from China, where millions of people working for overseas contractors assemble the phones.

Early in the second Trump administration, Apple and other companies are trying to quickly answer the president’s call to rouse American manufacturing. To do that, they are turning to investments and job growth that include previously planned spending or developments already under way.

Apple, like many of the most valuable U.S. companies, isn’t a major manufacturer. It designs products, writes software and creates chip blueprints, but outsources much of its production and markets the result. With the Trump administration imposing tariffs on Chinese imports and urging a renaissance of American manufacturing, Apple is turning to a familiar playbook.

Chief Executive Tim Cook on Monday trumpeted plans to spend $500 billion in the U.S. and add 20,000 jobs, highlighting a plan to open a server-manufacturing site in Houston and to double its Advanced Manufacturing Fund, which was formed in 2017 to invest in U.S. manufacturing projects, to $10 billion. Apple will work with its longtime manufacturing partner Foxconn for the Houston site.

Apple’s new jobs promises are slightly ahead of the company’s recent four-year pace, and the spending pledge is roughly on track with its recent investments, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. The AI server production facility in Houston is new, but the company has yet to spell out how many people it will continuously employ beyond saying it will create thousands of jobs. "
2025-02-24T21:48:20Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/618529/spacex-faa-nasa-starship-super-heavy-booster-explosion-upgrades,"SpaceX believes it knows what caused the explosion during the seventh test flight of its Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy booster on January 16th, 2025. Fires in the aft section of Starship, located between the bottom of its liquid oxygen tank and rear heat shield, caused “all but one of Starship’s engines to execute controlled shut down sequences” leading to a loss of communication and eventually the spacecraft’s safety system triggering its own destruction.

The goal of the seventh test flight was to test several upgrades SpaceX made to its heavy-lift rocket system. After a successful launch and completing a full duration burn, the Super Heavy booster separated from Starship and triggered a boostback burn designed to return it to the launch site. Following a landing burn, the Super Heavy booster was successfully caught mid-air by the launch tower at Starbase for the second time.


The mission didn’t go quite as well for Starship. Approximately two minutes after the spacecraft ignited its second stage Raptor engines following separation, a flash was observed in the aft section of Starship known as the attic, followed by sensors detecting a pressure rise from a leak. Two minutes after that, a second flash was observed, followed by sustained fires in the attic section that eventually “caused all but one of Starship’s engines to execute controlled shut down sequences and ultimately led to a loss of communication with the ship.”

Post-flight analysis indicated that Starship’s Autonomous Flight Safety System triggered a self-destruct approximately three minutes after the ground crew lost contact with the spacecraft. According to SpaceX, the most probable cause of the incident was vibrations that were much stronger during the flight than had been experienced during testing. That resulted in increased stress on the propulsion system’s hardware and, eventually, a propellant leak that “exceeded the venting capability of the ship’s attic area and resulted in sustained fires.”

The explosion created falling debris that looked more like a meteor shower over the islands of Turks and Caicos to several tourists who shared videos of the aftermath on social media. Although SpaceX says all the “debris came down within the pre-planned Debris Response Area,” the Federal Aviation Administration briefly slowed and diverted several flights in the area on January 16th as a result of the incident.

As part of the investigation into the explosion involving SpaceX, the FAA, NASA, the National Transportation Safety Board, and the U.S. Space Force, the company conducted a 60-second static test fire with the Starship that will be used on an upcoming eighth flight. Following the results of that test, SpaceX has made hardware changes to fuel feedlines as well as adjustments to propellant temperatures and operating thrust targets.

The company has also added additional vents and a “new purge system utilizing gaseous nitrogen” to the attic section of Starship designed to make that area more robust to propellant leakage.

SpaceX currently plans to launch an eighth test flight of Starship on February 28th, 2025, but is still “working with the FAA to either close the mishap investigation or receive a flight safety determination, along with working on a license authorization to enable its next flight of Starship.”"
2025-02-24T22:18:01Z,https://www.theverge.com/climate-change/618355/greenpeace-is-fighting-to-survive-in-court-today,"A pivotal trial over the embattled Dakota Access Pipeline opens today that could have grave consequences for protests in the US and the future of the environmental group Greenpeace.

Members of the Standing Rock Sioux and more than 500 other tribes protested the development of the pipeline alongside demonstrators who joined from across the US nearly a decade ago. Legal battles are still in motion, even after oil started flowing through the pipeline that runs from North Dakota to Illinois in 2017.

The company that operates Dakota Access, Energy Transfers, is suing Greenpeace for $300 million in a lawsuit that goes on trial this week. Energy Transfers claims that Greenpeace supported protesters’ “unlawful acts of trespass” and property destruction to stop construction. It also alleges that the organization spread false information about the company and concerns about the pipeline’s impact on the environment and cultural sites to the public and to banks financing the project.

“This directly impacts everybody, not just Standing Rock, not just Greenpeace.”

Paying that amount in damages would be equivalent to about 10 times Greenpeace USA’s annual budget, according to organization. “If we lose, Greenpeace USA could face financial ruin, ending over 50 years of environmental activism,” its website says.

The green group says it’s become the target of one of the largest SLAPP suits on the books, referencing
Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation meant to deter civic action. Grassroots activists from Standing Rock say the suit is a threat to free speech across the board, and that the spotlight on Greenpeace misrepresents a movement that was led by Indigenous protesters rather than any outside environmental organization.

”Freedom of speech is on the line,” says Waniya Locke, a member of Standing Rock Grassroots. “This directly impacts everybody, not just Standing Rock, not just Greenpeace.”

Greenpeace has racked up support from more than 400 different organizations and some celebrities including Billie Eilish, Jane Fonda, and Susan Sarandon who recently signed an open letter to Energy Transfer. The letter says that the suit is trying to hold Greenpeace accountable for actions taken by unaffiliated individuals and “attempts to rewrite the history of the Indigenous-led opposition movement at Standing Rock – by absurdly alleging that Greenpeace orchestrated the entire resistance.” The case could have a chilling effect on peaceful protest, the letter warns.

“Our lawsuit against Greenpeace is about them not following the law. It is not about free speech as they are trying to claim. We support the rights of all Americans to express their opinions and lawfully protest,” Energy Transfer spokesperson Jeff Tieszen said in an email to The Verge.

Considering the company made more than $82 billion in revenue last year and is seeking an amount in damages that would be devastating for Greenpeace but not as significant for the company, “My instinct here is that this is a SLAPP suit,” Josh Galperin, associate law professor at Pace University, tells NPR. “Their real concern is the persistence of the protest – the way it is capable of turning public opinion.”

A federal court dismissed a similar suit Energy Transfer filed against Greenpeace in 2017. North Dakota, however, is one of only 15 states without anti-SLAPP laws. “The facts don’t change,” says Greenpeace USA national campaigns director Rolf Skar. “They’re asking for money that we don’t have, that they don’t need, for a pipeline that is already operating and making them money when they filed their initial lawsuit. So this is about silencing us.” The trial is scheduled to end on March 27th."
2025-02-24T22:51:38Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/618603/elon-musk-email-firing-threat-agency-response-donald-trump,"We’re nearing the deadline that Elon Musk imposed for government workers to reply to a mass email about productivity, and the results have been predictably confusing — with even a direct statement from President Donald Trump failing to clear things up.

Government agencies have taken significantly different tacks toward the Musk-promoted email, which he announced to the public midday on February 22nd. Sent by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the message demanded all federal employees respond by the end of the 24th with “5 bullets of what you accomplished last week,” and Musk said on X that “failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.” The email reportedly didn’t include this noteworthy detail.

But while some agencies have apparently ordered compliance, others have called the email optional or told employees to not respond. The Department of Justice, Administrative Office of the US Courts, and State Department all instructed staff to disregard the message and follow internal review processes instead, according to multiple news outlets. The Treasury Department, conversely, appears to have ordered Internal Revenue Service employees to comply.

Other agencies have issued more nebulous guidance. In an email obtained by The Verge, Federal Trade Commission Chairman Andrew Ferguson told staff that responses were “voluntary” — but he added that “I enthusiastically responded” to the message and “strongly encourage you to respond as well.”

As of this article’s publication, the White House has done little to clarify the situation. An unnamed administration official said on Monday morning that employees should defer to their agencies’ guidance, reported Politico. An OPM official further told The Washington Post that the office was “unsure what to do with the emails” and had “no plans” to analyze them. Yet more anonymous officials, however, said that workers’ reports would be “fed into an artificial intelligence system to determine whether those jobs are necessary or not,” per NBC News.

Meanwhile, on the same day, Trump said publicly that people who failed to respond would be “sort of semi-fired,” adding that “a lot of people are not answering because they don’t even exist.” He denied that agencies were clashing with Musk by issuing conflicting guidance, saying it was “done in a friendly manner.”

Musk’s email echoed his behavior after taking over Twitter, where he demanded employees do things like print out 50 pages of their recent coding work or write a memo justifying their jobs to receive previously promised company stock. But unlike at Twitter, where he held sole unquestioned control, he’s dealing with formal chains of command and many other stakeholders here.

Still, the whole impossibly tangled situation is conducive to Musk and Trump’s goal of paralyzing the government, letting them instill fear in employees while creating an excuse to fire people as desired. (If they work on nuclear safety or bird flu, maybe they’ll get semi-rehired afterward.)


Like many moves by Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the latest action ignores existing government structures in a way that may be aimed at avoiding legal or political accountability. The email nonetheless drew an immediate challenge in court. It was included in an amended suit filed by groups including the American Federation of Government Employees, which condemned the email as “thoughtless and bullying … meant to intimidate federal employees and cause mass confusion.”

Ironically for figures who claim to be fighting bureaucratic confusion, Musk and Trump have created one of the most downright kafkaesque scenarios imaginable. We’re now looking at a government order presenting a drastic ultimatum that is never mentioned in the order, in which a response may be either mandatory or forbidden, and failing to respond may or may not get you simultaneously fired and not fired. Also, you may not actually exist."
2025-02-25T07:52:21Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/unilever-ceo-hein-schumacher-to-step-down-in-surprise-exit,"Unilever Plc pushed out Chief Executive Officer Hein Schumacher after less than two years, signaling that the board wasn’t satisfied with the pace of restructuring at the maker of Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream.

The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company said Chief Financial Officer Fernando Fernandez will take over as CEO on March 1 and hailed his ability to “drive change at speed,” hinting that the board wants to push Unilever’s transformation even faster.

Schumacher took over from Alan Jope in July 2023, at a time when investor confidence was low and after Unilever had granted activist investor Nelson Peltz a seat on the board. The Dutch executive quickly kicked off a shakeup that included plans to spin off its ice-cream business and cut costs.

Schumacher has tried to shift away from price-led growth where possible after a period of high inflation, focusing on expanding the volume of products sold. Unilever’s brands also include Dove soap, Knorr stock cubes and Pepsodent toothpaste.

Shifting Focus
The former boss of dairy cooperative Royal FrieslandCampina also watered down Unilever’s “purpose” agenda. Jope and his predecessor, Paul Polman, had argued household products espousing a social mission — such as empowering body confidence or promoting hygiene — perform better than those without. It was derided by some investors, who wanted to see more sales growth.


Shares of Unilever fell 1.7% in London on Tuesday. They’ve risen 8% during the tenure of Schumacher, who will stay on at the company until May 31.

“I regret leaving Unilever earlier than anticipated,” Schumacher said in email to Unilever staff seen by Bloomberg. “I stand by my record and approach.”

Chairman Ian Meakins said the decision for Schumacher to leave was mutual and the board was impressed with Fernandez’s “decisive and results-oriented approach” and “profound knowledge of Unilever’s operations.”

“While the board is pleased with Unilever’s performance in 2024, there is much further to go to deliver best-in-class results,” Meakins said.

Fernandez joined Unilever in 1988 and has overseen some of the company’s best-performing markets, including in Brazil and the Philippines. He was also president of the Latin America division.

Unilever’s decision to appoint a company lifer echoes a similar move at rival Nestle SA, which ousted CEO Mark Schneider last year and replaced him with Laurent Freixe, who has been with the Swiss food company for nearly four decades. Freixe also has experience in a number of farflung markets, including Latin America, which he ran for Nestle before becoming CEO.

Fernandez will be taking over with Unilever in the midst of spinning off its ice-cream arm. The company said this month it will list the unit primarily in Amsterdam, with London and New York getting secondary listings. Unilever also reported a 4% increase in group underlying sales in the fourth quarter, narrowly beating guidance, and said profit should improve modestly in 2025.


The results suggested the turnaround under Schumacher “had stalled somewhat, with weak guidance and sales growth only likely to improve as the company passes on higher commodity costs,” said Chris Beckett, head of equity research at Quilter Cheviot.

Unilever said Tuesday there is no change to its annual guidance.

“We met with Hein just over a week ago, and he seemed to us to be very much his normal ebullient self. We certainly didn’t see this coming,” said James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, who added that he was “gobsmacked” and “nonplussed” by the ejection of a CEO who was “universally” liked by investors.

“We wonder whether this is a victory for those Unilever insiders who resented the appointment of an external CEO and evidence of the old — and often dysfunctional — Unilever culture reasserting itself,” he said in a note to clients. “Fernando Fernandez, the incoming CEO, has been at Unilever for 37 years and might be a more acceptable change agent.”"
2025-02-25T09:39:19Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/india-considers-bankruptcy-law-revamp-as-cases-drag-on,"The Indian government is considering changes to its bankruptcy laws, including streamlining court processes, amid growing concerns over lengthy proceedings and low recovery rates.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India is finalizing a set of proposals aimed at speeding up resolution. Public consultation is set to end Tuesday, though the deadline may be extended.

Global investors have long been cautious about lending in India, where insolvency cases can often run for years with poor recoveries. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration revamped bankruptcy laws about a decade ago, mandating resolutions within 330 days, cases routinely exceed that limit. The delay erodes asset values as well as recovery rates for lenders.

“The time overruns in insolvency cases followed by the decline in recovery outcomes have been a cause of concern for all stakeholders,” said Hari Hara Mishra, chief executive officer of the Association of ARCs in India, a group that represents bad loan managers.

In nine months through December, it took 821 days on average for the courts to approve a resolution plan. That’s 35% longer than in the fiscal year ended March 2023, according to IBBI data. Liquidation orders took 655 days on average in the nine months through December. Meanwhile, investors on average recovered about 28% during the financial year ended March 2024, down from 46% in 2018-2019, data from the Reserve Bank of India show.


The new proposals aim to improve efficiency, including changes that would allow courts to manage insolvencies of complex, interconnected businesses via joint hearings rather than as standalone units.

Other measures seek to resolve creditor disputes without delaying a company’s progress toward a resolution plan, and encourage interim financing that would allow lenders to participate in creditor meetings as observers.

The improvements could benefit India’s bad debt managers, known as asset reconstruction companies, who buy non-performing loans from traditional lenders.

“Interim financiers help retain asset value in an insolvency case,” said Puneet Jain, chief investment officer at Neo Asset Management, a money manager who oversees over $3 billion. “If they gain more clout in the corporate insolvency process it will pave the way for private credit funds to do more business in special situations.”"

2025-02-25T21:02:56Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/619345/volvo-es90-range-battery-charging-ev-voltage,"Volvo is continuing to drop hints about its upcoming high-tech electric sedan, the ES90, ahead of the EV’s official reveal next month. Today, the Swedish automaker provided new details about the ES90’s range and battery efficiency, calling it “a car that goes further and charges faster than any electric Volvo before.”

That’s mostly thanks to the ES90’s new-for-Volvo 800-volt architecture, putting it on par with other fast-charging EVs like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6. The new architecture is an upgrade from previous Volvo EVs, like the $80,000 EX90 SUV, which features a 400-volt system.

Volvo claims that the ES90 will be able to add 300km (186 miles) of range in just 10 minutes when plugged into a 350kW fast-charging station (depending on the outdoor temperature). Moreover, it will offer a driving range of up to 700km (435 miles) under the more generous WLTP testing cycle.


Automakers are increasingly trending toward higher voltage systems in the hopes of luring in more customers who are turned off by slow charging speeds and the prospect of being stuck at a public charging station for 40 minutes or more. Stellantis, parent company of Jeep and Ram, recently announced a new 800-volt flexible architecture for some of its upcoming EVs.

Volvo said it needed to upgrade a number of its components in order to support the higher voltage system, including battery cells, motors, inverters, and thermal parts. The new motors were lighter and more efficient, and the overall system now creates less heat, meaning the battery can be charged at a faster rate without overloading the electrical system.

Volvo also plans to introduce a new, in-house-developed battery management software for the ES90, provided by Breathe Battery Technologies, which also received investments from Volvo’s corporate venture capital arm. The new software will slash the amount of time it takes to charge from 10 to 80 percent by as much as 30 percent, down to 20 minutes.

The ES90 will also feature a slew of recycled materials, including 29 percent of the aluminum, 16 percent of polymers, and 18 percent of steel. Wood panels inside the ES90 are made from FSC-certified wood, Volvo says. The automaker is also introducing a new blockchain-based battery “passport” to track raw materials like lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite used in the battery.

2025-02-25T22:21:08Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/619434/apple-fixing-voice-transcription-bug-trump-racist,"Apple has acknowledged a peculiar bug with the iPhone’s dictation feature that briefly displays “Trump” when someone says the word “racist.” The Verge has been unable to reproduce the issue, but it picked up attention on Tuesday after a video demonstrating the strange substitution went viral on TikTok and other social media.

The company provided a statement to The New York Times and Fox News confirming the bug. “We are aware of an issue with the speech recognition model that powers dictation, and we are rolling out a fix as soon as possible,” an unnamed spokesperson said, according to Fox News.



Apparently the issue boils down to phonetic overlap between “Trump” and “racist.” The company told Fox News that other words with an “r” consonant are also occasionally affected. But John Burkey, who formerly worked on the Siri team at Apple, told the Times that Trump’s name appearing “smells like a serious prank” that could have been purposefully carried out by someone internally.

Regardless of the technical reason behind it, the awkward glitch comes a day after Apple announced plans to invest more than $500 billion in the United States over the next four years. The company is looking to blunt the potential impact of tariffs put into place by President Donald Trump, with a 10 percent tariff already in effect on goods imported from China, and a 25 percent tariff threatened for chips."
2025-02-25T23:03:22Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/619412/doge-acting-administrator-amy-gleason-named,"The White House has named Amy Gleason as the acting administrator of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The news, delivered by an unnamed White House official to CNBC and other media outlets, follows days of obfuscation in courtrooms, the press, and the pseudo-department itself. It designates Gleason a likely target for the nigh-continuous legal challenges over DOGE’s access to sensitive data and freezing of government funds — while potentially shielding its high-level leader Elon Musk.

Gleason’s LinkedIn profile indicates she previously served in the US Digital Service (which has since been converted to serve DOGE’s efforts) and worked for the healthcare investment firm Russell Street Ventures. It’s unclear when she was given her current title or whether there are plans for a permanent head of DOGE. And earlier today, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt refused to name a formal administrator for the group. “I am not going to reveal the name of that individual from this podium,” Leavitt said, telling reporters she would be “happy to follow up” later to provide it.


Gleason was already identified as a possible leader in a February 18th Wired story, where USDS employees described her as a liaison between DOGE, USDS, and other agencies. But at that point, Wired noted that “little is known about her official role” and said even employees weren’t sure who was supposed to be in charge.

The government has been cagey about who formally runs DOGE while leaving little doubt about who’s in charge. Leavitt and others have repeatedly identified Musk as overseeing DOGE’s overall operation. At the same time, they’ve denied that he has any formal association with it, saying he’s merely a special government employee serving as an advisor.

This extends to statements made under oath in weeks of courtroom drama — as numerous state attorneys general and private actors argue that DOGE is operating illegally, while the government seeks to insulate Musk and avoid naming anyone the challengers could sue. A February 17th court filing asserted that Musk had “no actual or formal authority” in DOGE. Later, in a hearing on February 24th, Department of Justice lawyer Bradley Humphreys told Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly that he didn’t know if anyone led the organization at all.

“Is there an administrator of DOGE at the present time?” Kollar-Kotelly asked.

“I don’t know the answer to that,” Humphreys replied."
2025-02-26T18:34:53Z,https://www.theverge.com/ad/612525/five-predictions-for-crypto-2025-saga,"Crypto is, once again, exploding. Momentum born of a potentially friendlier regulatory atmosphere has met rising coin values, with Bitcoin more than doubling in value last year. Meanwhile, powered by advances to the underlying infrastructure, crypto is evolving beyond speculation and into real utility. That’s driving new use cases for AI and enabling seamless experiences across gaming and more.

Saga has emerged as a key enabler of these shifts, providing scalable, on-demand blockspace for AI, gaming, and decentralized finance (DeFi). The company’s efforts are facilitating industry acceleration — “more, faster,” as Saga puts it — expected to continue throughout 2025. With that in mind, here are a few predictions for what’s to come.

AI will unlock new possibilities
Artificial intelligence continues to work its way into more and more of our daily lives. It’s getting better at automating tasks and enhancing our work, and continued investments will only keep growing AI’s influence. But when it comes to certain real-world datasets, AI runs into some limitations. It would never be trusted with the keys to its own bank account, for instance.


But its own crypto wallet? That’s feasible. AI-driven DeFi strategies could reshape trading, lending, and asset management. AI is quickly becoming more capable than human beings at things like algorithmic trading, assessing borrower reliability, dynamically adjusting interest rates, and even portfolio management. But, to take on its growing workload with trustless execution and true autonomy, AI needs blockchain.

Although this activity represents just a small fraction of transactions today, futurists believe there will be a shift over time so that humans become a participant alongside AI agents. Saga’s AI agent chain infrastructure will prove critical to this shift, accounting for the added strain to blockchains by providing unlimited horizontal scaling to meet demand.

The market will find solutions to fragmentation
It used to be that there was just one blockchain. Then there were five. And then, suddenly, there were hundreds, built to house and accommodate the exploding number of cryptocurrencies. That has complicated industry growth for perhaps obvious reasons: When a user sees their currency go up in value, or when they win at a casino-like game and want to quickly cash in, there’s no obvious way to do so. It could take that user some three weeks for the currency to cross an infrastructure bridge and reach an account for a withdrawal.


But the bigger issue, still, is how fragmentation holds crypto back from preventing seamless cross-chain economies. Saga’s Liquidity Integration Layer solves this long-standing problem by creating a seamless flow of liquidity across chains. It makes liquidity composable and gasless, which renders unnecessary the consolidation in the token market that so many industry players have been calling for. The result for gamers, developers, and others is an ecosystem in which liquidity flows easily from one game to the next, from one use case to the next — realizing its utility as a safer and more transparent form of currency.

Top gaming brands will integrate blockchain
Traditional gaming has been in flux. Cost of user acquisition is skyrocketing. The boom-time growth gaming companies experienced during the pandemic has largely fallen back to earth, precipitating layoffs at a few major shops. Meanwhile, games have become more expensive to build.


So it’s no wonder that more traditional gaming companies have started steering into blockchain, seeing it as a path not only to better revenue but as a way to build a fervorous fan base. Blockchain enables real asset ownership for players, which drives higher engagement and monetization for developers. It moves gaming firms beyond predatory microtransactions and into a world of sustainable revenue models. It also enables interoperable economies that reduce friction between games.

As an infrastructure component built to enable that new reality both for web 3 developers — where it’s the layer 1 of choice for gaming — and traditional gaming platforms, Saga has seen momentum on both sides of the coin. Adoption from AAA titles is moving quickly — Saga’s in-house game publishing studio, Saga Origins, works with established leaders like Lussa and Angelic. To keep up with the demand, the company recently bolstered its internal talent, adding Samsung alum Fernando Vasconez to the fold last month.

DeFi infrastructure within gaming will take a leap forward
Alongside that growing, two-sided interest in crypto, maturity in DeFi infrastructure will enable the gaming industry to move fully into a new era, overcoming the pitfalls of walled-garden blockchain games.

The foundational infrastructure provided by Saga is tailored to gaming ecosystems. That means it’s easier than ever to develop economies that span multiple games. DeFi gaming experiments fell flat during the last cycle as poor tokenomics, inflationary rewards, and a lack of liquidity cut down any chance at a functional system. With Saga’s infrastructure enabling cross-platform liquidity flows, utilizing tokens and developing a bank that flows quickly across games and platforms has been made simple. Players can now enjoy sustainable, interoperable economies that span multiple games, platforms, and chains.

Blockchain space will be in heavy demand
The market’s swirl of new developments points to one thing: A surge in the demand for blockchain space. As one illuminating example, when the president launched his memecoin in January, the related surge on Solana reportedly caused network difficulties on the chain. That incident illuminates a larger failure of scalability present across chains.

Even beyond high-profile launches, there’s reason to believe capacity will need to scale quickly this year. The rise of AI agents alone will add significant strain to the system, and traditional L1s will struggle to keep up. Saga’s infrastructure, built to support infinite block space, is prepared to take on all that demand — and provide builders experimenting with AI the runway they need.

One thing is certain: Blockchain is becoming more ubiquitous in our daily lives, and the underlying infrastructure will have to keep up. Saga’s technical breakthroughs are enabling rapid growth across blockchain gaming, AI, and DeFi.

2025-02-26T20:58:29Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/620145/amazon-alexa-plus-no-early-echo-device-support,"Amazon is bringing the new AI-powered Alexa Plus to a wide range of its existing Echo devices — but the upgrade will skip many of the earliest models. The majority of the company’s first-generation Echos won’t get support, according to the Alexa Plus FAQ page, though Amazon says they will continue to work with the standard Alexa.

Alexa Plus won’t support “certain older generation Echo devices,” such as the first-generation Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus, Echo Tap, Echo Spot, and Echo Show; the second-generation Echo Show won’t support it, either. Amazon spokesperson Kristy Schmidt confirmed that is the full list of devices. If so, that still leaves many early Echo devices that will work with Alexa Plus.

That means I’ll be able to ask Alexa to book a restaurant reservation through my Echo Flex, the quirky modular Echo speaker that plugs straight into a wall outlet. And people can still get an AI-generated song piped through speakers they’ve connected their microphone-only Echo Inputs to. And if you have an ancient first- or- second-gen Echo Show 15 or newer Echo Hub, those will apparently get access to the AI-enhanced Alexa, too. Schmidt confirmed that each of those will be compatible.


Perhaps it’s a bummer that some of the older Echo devices won’t use AI to book reservations, track ticket prices, or generate fake songs. But at least they’ll still be able to do the old Alexa stuff, like turn on your lights or tell you the weather. And given rumors about the struggle Amazon has had getting Alexa Plus to work right, that might be a good thing, at least for a while."
2025-02-26T22:04:14Z,https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/620170/microsoft-official-xbox-wireless-controller-deal-sale,"Of the three major gaming consoles, the Xbox Series X / S may have the most diverse controller selection, but Microsoft’s basic Xbox Wireless Controller is still the best Xbox controller for most people. That’s mostly because it’s the cheapest one you can buy with native support for Xbox’s built-in wireless protocol (you can also use it with PC and mobile via Bluetooth or USB-C), but it’s also just really solid overall.

It’s hard to beat the value, especially when they’re on sale for as low as $39, just a few dollars more than their all-time low, as they are in select colors at Amazon and Walmart right now. That’ll get you the basic crop of colors such as black, white, and blue. You can spend a bit more to get the awesome translucent models, which are starting at $57.50 (about $12 off) at Amazon and Walmart.

The Xbox Wireless Controller isn’t loaded with fancy features and gimmicks like newer, more expensive controllers. You can’t easily remove or replace any of its parts, for example, nor does it have back buttons, sensitivity adjustments, or built-in means for customizing and swapping button mapping configurations. But it still sets the standard for how a controller should look, feel, and work. The ergonomic shape and button layout are still the most widely emulated of any controller, perhaps ever.

Some people still scoff that it doesn’t have a rechargeable internal battery, but that’s a point in its favor. Its versatile battery bay lets you either use standard AA batteries or slot in a rechargeable pack. Some of those batteries offer much more play time than controllers with built-in batteries. You’ll never have to plug it in or dock it if you have a charged spare handy, and you won’t have to dismantle an entire controller or shell out for a replacement once they run dry"
2025-02-27T03:54:18Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/alphabet-s-google-said-to-cut-employees-in-cloud-division,"Alphabet Inc.’s Google on Wednesday cut staffers in its cloud division, according to people familiar with the matter.

The reductions affected fewer than 100 people working in sales operations and were intended to free resources invest in the business and artificial intelligence, according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the move hasn’t been publicly announced. A Google spokesperson said in a statement that the company continues to make adjustments to “meet our customers’ needs and the significant opportunity ahead.”

“As teams have been doing across the company, we’re making changes to continue to invest in areas that are critical to our business and ensure our long-term success,” the spokesperson said.

The retrenchment comes in the wake of slower growth from Google’s cloud business, as well as massive spending aimed at supporting the tech giant’s ambitions in AI. Earlier this month, Alphabet missed analysts’ revenue projections for cloud, and its guidance for 2025 capital expenditures also far exceeded expectations.


Google’s reductions in cloud headcount follow previous, smaller moves by the company to downsize. In late January, as first reported by 9to5Google, the company announced a “voluntary exit program” for employees working in its Platforms and Devices unit — a group of staffers from its Pixel hardware and Android software division that were merged in 2024 into one team. Throughout 2024, Google made cuts that slowly rippled across the company as it went through a process of reorganization unit by unit.

The cloud layoffs come as the tech industry’s culling of its corporate workforces has become all but standard in a new year. Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Salesforce Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are among those that have said they will cut underperforming employees or seek to hire cheaper international labor. The companies are under pressure to invest in AI technologies without risking profits.

Google Cloud, which is regarded as one of the company’s best bets for growth as the search business matures, remains a key area of investment. During the company’s earnings call in February, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi said the company expects “some head count growth in 2025 in key investment areas such as AI and cloud.”

2025-02-27T04:12:09Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/india-s-glance-deepens-pact-with-google-to-add-ai-content,"Indian mobile-content provider Glance is deepening its ties with backer Google, seeking to tap the US internet giant’s expertise in generative artificial intelligence to build new apps.

Glance will work with Google Cloud and use its tech such as Gemini AI and Imagen, a text-to-image model, to create content for customers who use its smartphone and TV screensavers, the companies said in a statement Wednesday.

Glance InMobi Pte. delivers a curated screensaver for smart televisions and mobile devices, which shows users content such as news without them having to unlock their displays or open any apps. It says it has more than 300 million active users in countries including India, the US, Japan and Indonesia.

Bangalore-based Glance didn’t specify if the partnership involved a new round of funding from Google. Glance was set to raise as much as $250 million in a funding round led by the Alphabet Inc. unit, Bloomberg News reported previously.

The new pact broadens Google’s bet on India, the world’s most populous country, where it competes with homegrown and global rivals including Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. as they scout for new growth frontiers. Google’s Android is the South Asian country’s dominant mobile operating system, but competition from Apple Inc. is intensifying, thanks to an aspirational middle class who’re keen to buy pricey iPhones.

Glance’s largest holder is mobile-advertising firm InMobi Pte. Naveen Tewari, an alumnus of Harvard Business School, founded InMobi in 2007 with fellow engineering and business-school peers. InMobi won the backing of SoftBank Group Corp. and went on to become the first venture-backed Indian startup to reach unicorn status in 2011. Tewari then co-founded Glance in 2019.

The startup raised money from Google in late 2020. It won the backing of Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani in 2022 with a $200 million investment that valued the company at more than $1 billion.

Glance also said it is preparing to unveil a new generative AI-driven platform for its customers which will first be launched in the US."
2025-02-27T05:35:25Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-27/mercedes-set-to-cut-jobs-in-china-as-local-competition-heats-up,"Mercedes-Benz Group AG and its subsidiaries are planning to cut up to 15% of the automaker’s workforce in China, mainly within its financing and sales units, as the German manufacturer faces intensifying competition in the world’s largest car market, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Mercedes-Benz Automobile Finance Co. and Beijing Mercedes-Benz Sales Service Co. are set to bear the brunt of the job cuts, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak publicly. The units are struggling to compete with Chinese institutions, including state-owned banks, that can offer more attractive car loans to buyers, one of the people said.

The automaker has already begun job cuts, including not renewing contracts for some fixed-term staff, but the layoffs have accelerated this month, according to the people. Mercedes-Benz’s plans are subject to change and the company is yet to make a final decision on the scope of the layoffs, which may fall short of 15% of the workforce, they said.

It’s unclear whether the move will affect the automaker’s local head office or the production units it runs through joint ventures with Chinese firms. Mercedes-Benz Group China said in a statement to Bloomberg News that it’s worked with employees to adjust operations based on the competitive environment and market demands.

Mercedes’ decision shows the struggles facing foreign carmakers in China. Major legacy brands have swiftly lost ground to a wave of agile domestic marques, led by BYD Co., that have won over drivers with their quicker-to-market and tech-laden electric vehicles. An economic downturn has dealt an additional blow, with Chinese consumers growing more cautious about spending their money.

The German automaker isn’t alone in looking to streamline its presence in China. Last year, local media reported layoffs at Porsche AG’s Chinese unit. Meanwhile, BMW AG’s China unit didn’t renew contracts with some employees last year, affecting between 2% and 5% of its workforce, and has plans for a similar move this year, according to a company spokesperson.

Mercedes said last month that sales in China dropped 7% last year, dragging down global deliveries."
2025-02-27T20:42:04Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/621114/microsoft-copilot-app-macos-download,"Microsoft is releasing a native Copilot app for macOS today. Much like the Windows app, the Copilot version for Mac will provide access to the web-based version of Microsoft’s AI assistant, where you can upload images and generate images or text.

The macOS version of Copilot also includes a dark mode and a shortcut command to activate the AI assistant by using Command + Space — much like the Alt + Space on the Windows version. Microsoft is launching this new Copilot Mac app in the US, UK, and Canada today, and the iPad version is also being updated with a split screen mode.

You’ll also now be able to log into Copilot on an iPhone or iPad with an Apple ID, and upload text or PDF files to ask questions about the documents or generate a summary about them. This document summarization feature is also coming to the macOS app soon.


The launch of Copilot on macOS comes just days after Microsoft made Copilot Voice and Think Deeper free with unlimited use. Previously, both Think Deeper (powered by OpenAI’s o1 model) and Voice in Copilot had limits for free users, but Microsoft has now removed these to allow Copilot users to have extended conversations with the company’s AI assistant."
2025-02-27T21:15:11Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/621116/cricut-maker-explore-4-crafting-cutting-machine,"Cricut has announced new versions of its crafting machines designed to print, cut, and emboss various materials using a collection of swappable tools. The new Cricut Maker 4 and Cricut Explore 4 are the first updates to both machines in nearly four years and offer faster cutting speeds for some materials, improved accuracy, and cheaper price tags.

The machines will be available starting on February 28th, 2025. They’ll still start at $249.99 for the Cricut Explore 4, and at $399.99 for the Cricut Maker 4, and both will be available in sage and seashell color options. The four-year-old Cricut Explore 3 sells for $319, while the Maker 3 is $439, so the cheaper price tags for the 4-series line could help make the new machines more accessible to new users. Both models come with a bundle of crafting materials to complete 10 initial projects.

The Cricut Maker 4 and Explore 4 look nearly identical to their predecessors but are up to twice as fast when cutting through materials like cardstock and vinyl, Cricut says. The speed improvements won’t be quite as dramatic when using thicker materials, but the upgrade will still appeal to crafters who sell their creations on sites like Etsy and are looking to upgrade their output.


Cricut has also introduced a new optical sensor on both models that works alongside a light that better illuminates materials, according to CNET. The upgrade should help improve cutting accuracy, no matter what the lighting conditions are in your crafting room.

Although there are differences between both machines’ capabilities, they’re mostly dependent on the types of projects you’re looking to create. The pricier Cricut Maker 4 is designed to work with over 300 different types of materials, including thicker options like leather and balsa wood, and a wider variety of cutting and embossing tools. The cheaper Cricut Explore 4 is limited to around 100 different materials, including thinner stock like vinyl, card stock, and iron-ons.

In 2021, the company frustrated existing users with plans to limit monthly uploads to its Design Space software used to prep projects before sending them to the machines. Subscription fees were announced for users wanting to expand the number of designs they could upload, but after much backlash, Cricut scrapped those plans entirely.

While the new machines don’t require subscriptions, the company still offers a Cricut Access subscription for users who heavily rely on pre-made designs and projects available through its Design Space app. Cricut Access also expands the number of fonts and images available through the app and includes discounts on materials."
2025-02-27T21:15:38Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/621195/apple-parents-kids-accounts-share-age-ranges,"Apple announced in a whitepaper that it plans to introduce a bunch of new child safety features, including letting parents share their kids’ age ranges with apps, refreshing the App Store’s age ratings system, and making it easier for parents to set up Child Accounts for their kids. The company says it will introduce the features “this year.”

Companies like Meta, Snap, and X have called for platforms to be responsible for verifying the ages of users at the OS or app store level. Apple also reportedly lobbied against a proposed bill in Louisiana that would have required the company to enforce age restrictions.

In the whitepaper, Apple argues that age verification “at the app marketplace level” wouldn’t be ideal, as it would require users to hand over “sensitive personally identifying information” to the company. “That’s not in the interest of user safety or privacy,” Apple says.


The age sharing system gestures in that direction without going so far as to fully verify each user’s age. With the age range feature, “parents can allow their kids to share the age range associated with their Child Accounts with app developers,” Apple says.

The age range will “be shared with developers if and only if parents decide to allow this information to be shared,” and parents will be able to disable sharing. The feature also won’t “provide kids’ actual birthdates.” Developers will be able to request the age ranges with a new API that Apple says is a “narrowly tailored, data-minimizing, privacy-protecting tool to assist app developers who can benefit from it.”

“Today’s announcement is a positive first step, however, developers can only apply these age-appropriate protections with a teen’s approval,” Meta spokesperson Jamie Radice says in a statement to The Verge. “Parents tell us they want to have the final say over the apps their teens use, and that’s why we support legislation that requires app stores to verify a child’s age and get a parent’s approval before their child downloads an app.”

As for App Store ratings will expand from four thresholds to five; the new categories will be Age 4 plus, 9 plus, 13 plus, 16 plus, and 18 plus. In their app listings, developers will be asked to highlight “whether apps contain user-generated content or advertising capabilities that can impact the presence of age-inappropriate content” and if apps have their own content controls.

Apple says that the App Store won’t show kids apps with age ratings “in the places where we feature apps on our storefront” that are higher than what their parents set on their accounts.

As for Child Accounts, Apple says that it will introduce a new setup process and let parents fix the age associated with the account if it wasn’t set up correctly.

During an interview with Bloomberg, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company has a “brand new lineup of devices that are coming in the fall that are beautiful.”

On Wednesday, Amazon revealed Alexa Plus, a more conversational version of the smart assistant that’s capable of performing a wider range of tasks, such as ordering an Uber or finding concert tickets. Amazon says “almost every” Alexa device will support Alexa Plus, save for older Echo generations. Alexa Plus will cost $19.99 per month but will be included with a subscription to Prime.



Though Jassy didn’t share any other details about the new devices, it seems like the company plans to put an even bigger focus on displays. When asked about Amazon’s next-generation hardware, Panos Panay, Amazon’s head of devices and services, told my colleague Jennifer Tuohy that, “I believe in screens. I think they matter in a massive way.”

We’ve already seen this outlook impact Amazon’s lineup of products, as the company launched a new Echo Show with a larger 21-inch display after Panay joined in 2023."
2025-02-27T23:05:51Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/621252/meta-ai-chatbot-standalone-app,"Meta is planning to launch a dedicated app for its AI chatbot, according to a report from CNBC. The Verge can also confirm that Meta is working on the standalone app. The new app could launch in the second quarter of this year, CNBC says, joining the growing number of standalone AI apps, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot.

Meta has already brought its AI chatbot across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, but launching a standalone app could help the company reach people who don’t already use those platforms. Similar to rival chatbots, Meta AI can answer questions, generate images, edit photos, and more. It recently gained the ability to use its “memory” to provide better recommendations.

RelatedMeta fires 20 employees for leaking

In a response to CNBC’s report, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joked, “ok fine maybe we’ll do a social app.” Meta declined to comment.

Meta has ramped up its efforts to compete in the AI industry in recent months, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg announcing plans to invest up to $65 billion to further the company’s AI ambitions. The company also plans on holding an event dedicated to AI on April 29th."
2025-02-28T07:18:42Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/india-needs-7-8-growth-to-become-high-income-world-bank-says,"India’s economy needs to expand at an average growth rate of 7.8% over the coming decades to become a high-income country, according to a World Bank report.

“For India to become a high-income economy by 2047, its gross national income per capita would have to increase by nearly 8 times over the current levels,” the Washington-based organization said on Friday.

The report comes just hours before India is set to release gross domestic product figures for the last quarter. While the economy likely rebounded during the period, its growth prospects remain uncertain in coming months given rising geopolitical tensions. For the current fiscal year, the nation is expected to expand at 6.4% — the weakest pace since the pandemic.

The world’s most populous nation is currently on track to become an upper middle-income country by 2032, but it will need two more decades of “very high growth” to reach its target of becoming an advanced economy by 2047 — its 100th anniversary of independence from Britain — the anti-poverty lender said.


India’s gross national income per capita stood at $2,540 as of 2023, according to the World Bank. That number would have to grow to $20,000 by 2047 for the country to reach high-income status, it added.

Only a handful of countries have managed to make the transition from middle to high income in less than two decades. Many nations, including Brazil, Malaysia, Mexico and South Africa have languished in the middle-income trap for two decades, the lender said.

To reach its growth goals, the South Asian country will have to focus on capital investment, labor reforms and boosting productivity, it added.

The world’s fastest-growing economy has a limited window to leverage its demographic dividend. Over the next three decades, the dependency ratio — the number of children and elderly taken care of by the working-age population — is projected to increase from 45% in 2032 to 49% in 2050, the report said, adding that India should urgently boost labor force participation and job creation."
2025-02-28T15:47:12Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/621537/apple-watch-carbon-neutral-lawsuit,"Apple customers filed a class action lawsuit against the company, alleging it misled consumers with claims that certain Apple Watches are carbon neutral. For a product to be considered carbon neutral, its manufacturer has to offset or cancel out any pollution the item generates.

Apple said in 2023 that “select case and band combinations” of its Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and Apple Watch SE would be the company’s first carbon neutral devices. The suit was filed on behalf of anyone who bought those watches. It alleges that the products were not really carbon neutral because they relied on faulty offset projects that didn’t actually reduce the company’s greenhouse gas pollution.

The lawsuit shows how difficult it is to make promises about a product’s sustainability by attempting to offset or capture the carbon dioxide emissions it generates. Many environmental advocates have instead pushed for tech companies to switch from fossil fuels to cleaner energy, and to make products that last longer and are easier to repair.

Make products that last longer and are easier to repair

The company’s carbon neutral claims were false, and the seven plaintiffs would not have purchased the Apple Watches or paid as much for them had they known that, the lawsuit alleges. “Apple’s false advertising may lead [consumers] to choose its products over genuinely sustainable alternatives,” the complaint filed in a California federal court on Wednesday says.

Apple is standing by its assertions. “We are proud of our carbon neutral products, which are the result of industry-leading innovation in clean energy and low-carbon design,” Apple spokesperson Sean Redding said in an email.

Redding says the company reduced Apple Watch emissions by more than 75 percent. The company focused on cutting pollution from materials, electricity, and transportation used to make the watches, in part by getting more of its suppliers to switch to clean energy.

To deal with the remaining pollution, Redding says Apple invests in “nature-based projects to remove hundreds of thousands of metric tons of carbon from the air.” That’s where the new lawsuit finds problems.

To offset their emissions, many companies buy carbon credits from forestry projects that represent tons of planet-heating carbon dioxide that trees and soil naturally trap. Apple primarily purchased credits from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya and the Guinan Project in China, the suit says. It alleges that neither of the projects met a basic standard for carbon offsets, which is that they capture additional CO2 that would not otherwise have been sequestered had Apple not paid to support the project.


The Chyulu Hills Project purports to generate carbon credits by preventing deforestation on land which has been legally protected from deforestation since 1983, while the Guinan Project claims to have planted trees on “barren land” that was already heavily forested before the project began. In both cases, the carbon reductions would have occurred regardless of Apple’s involvement or the projects’ existence. And because Apple’s carbon neutrality claims are predicated on the efficacy and legitimacy of these projects, Apple’s carbon neutrality claims are false and misleading.

Apple is far from the only company to have faced accusations about carbon offset projects. Dozens of big-name brands — including airlines, retailers, banks, and more — have relied on “junk” carbon offsets to make carbon neutral claims, a 2022 Bloomberg investigation found.

This also isn’t the first time Apple’s first carbon neutral products have faced scrutiny. The company needs to be more transparent about its supply chain in order to back its carbon neutral claims, the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs said in a separate report in 2023. That report found that some Apple suppliers’ emissions were growing.

A better measure of a company’s environmental impact is whether its entire carbon footprint — encompassing its operations, supply chain, and the use of its products — is shrinking. A company can purport to make a more sustainable product, but it could potentially wind up selling so many of those products that the company as a whole has a bigger carbon footprint.

RelatedRight to repair: all the latest news and updates
So, for consumers who want to limit their own carbon footprint, they’re probably better off hanging on to their current devices for as long as they can. For its part, Apple’s carbon footprint as a company got smaller between 2021 and 2023, even without taking carbon offsets into account, according to its latest sustainability report. But Apple still churned out 16.1 million metric tons of CgO2 emissions in 2023, roughly equivalent to the emissions from 42 gas-fired power plants in a year. And while Apple has made some strides, there’s still a long way to go to make devices easier to repair."
2025-02-28T16:20:10Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/621650/intel-ohio-chip-factory-delayed-2030,"Intel is delaying the opening of its $28 billion Ohio chip plants yet again. In an update on Friday, Intel executive vice president Naga Chandrasekaran said the company now expects its first factory to begin operations between 2030 and 2031 – years later than its initial plan to kick off production in 2025.

Meanwhile, the second fabrication plant on Intel’s Ohio campus isn’t expected to open until 2032. “We are taking a prudent approach to ensure we complete the project in a financially responsible manner,” Chandrasekaran said in the post. “We will continue construction at a slower pace, while maintaining the flexibility to accelerate work and the start of operations if customer demand warrants.”

RelatedWhat happened to Intel?

Intel’s Ohio fabrication units have been beset by delays since the very beginning. In 2022, the chipmaker postponed the groundbreaking ceremony over a lack of government funding. It later bumped the opening of its plants to 2027 or 2028.

The past year has been tumultuous for Intel. The company grappled with mass layoffs, major financial losses, and the removal of Pat Gelsigner as CEO. In January, Intel revealed that it’s canceling its AI chip as the company attempts to “simplify” its roadmap and “concentrate” resources.

As noted by The Columbus Dispatch, Intel has invested $3.7 billion into its Ohio chip plants since 2022. The company says it has completed the basement level of its fab and has since started to work on the above-ground structure. Chandrasekaran added that the delay “allows us to manage our capital responsibly and adapt to the needs of our customers.”"

We’re fresh off CES, where we saw plenty of new gadgets, from TVs to gaming handhelds and smart glasses. But, as it says right in the name, MWC 2025 is more focused on... mobile stuff. And it’s for a global audience, which means not everything will make its way to the US.

Expect announcements from companies like Xiaomi and Nothing, the latter of which will unveil the Nothing Phone 3A, and other global phone makers. Larger firms like Samsung and Google will be there, though it’s still unclear if they’ll have news. But we’re still waiting for more details on Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Edge, so maybe that’ll pop up at the show.

We’ll also look for more obscure and fun stuff that’s only available here on the floor. In 2024, we saw Humane’s ill-fated AI Pin (RIP), a laptop with a transparent screen, and more.

Keep this page bookmarked for all the news, commentary, and first looks from the show floor.

MWC 2025 was all about the odds and ends

Mobile World Congress shows us the best and wackiest new ideas in mobile tech every year, with a side of jamón and “Oh, shit, was that the king of Spain who just walked by?” It’s a real trip. But this year’s conference was a mix of unusually odd oddities, including phone camera concepts I swear we tried 15 years ago to screens you can bend every which way.

The phones themselves were predictable, and, often, predictably good. It was everything else in the margins that was weird: phones with weird back panels, things you put on your phone, or just really cool phone-adjacent screens.

The best stuff we’ve seen at MWC so far

Mobile World Congress 2025 is well under way in Barcelona, Spain, and while there’s still one day left, the mobile-focused show has already delivered lots of new laptops, smartphones, concepts, and innovative accessories.

Some of the biggest announcements were made over the weekend, so we want to make sure you didn’t miss anything. Here are the best gadgets that have debuted at MWC 2025 so far, but there’s still more to come. You can catch up on all of our coverage of the show right here.


This little AI phone has some wild ideas
DSC09960_processed
It was just a year ago that I had my first demo of the Humane AI pin — which was also my last, as it turned out. But another AI gadget at this year’s MWC is trying to take off where Humane crashed and burned, and in ways it’s even weirder than the AI pin. It’s a phone that captures tons of information about you, both past and present, and uses it to create your own AI avatar to act as a virtual assistant. It’s part Rabbit R1, part Gemini Assistant, part science fiction. And oh yeah; there’s some blockchain stuff too. I told you, it’s wild.

The team behind Newnal AI is based in San Francisco and Korea, and established itself by creating a blockchain-based vaccine verification method used widely in Korea. Early in my meeting with the company’s founder YT Kim, he stressed one thing to me: “We never sold cryptocurrency.” They’re clearly aware of the bad vibes around blockchain right now.

What if your phone’s camera was much, much bigger?
mwc-xiaomi-realme-camera-concepts-5
The cameras on our phones won’t stop getting bigger. Xiaomi’s new 15 Ultra is dominated by an enormous ring of cameras on the back, Nothing has rethought its camera layout from scratch to fit a periscope into the Phone 3A Pro, and consistent rumors suggest that even Apple is going to strap a big ol’ camera bar onto the back of its iPhone 17 Pro models later this year. But why stop there? What if you could get all of the heft and weight of a real camera and burden your phone with it? What if we could make your phone camera much, much bigger?

That’s what both Xiaomi and Realme have attempted to do at this year’s Mobile World Congress, with two very different concept phones that each attempt to bridge the gap between a smartphone and a DSLR.

For a phone show, there’s an awful lot of cool non-phone stuff at Mobile World Congress this year. Take Lenovo’s ThinkBook Flip concept, which answers the question: “What if your laptop unfolded, and then unfolded again?” Samsung’s Display group has been apparently thinking along the same lines, because it has some interesting new folding concepts at MWC including a briefcase screen and a foldable gaming handheld, which I want, like, yesterday.

Samsung Display is, of course, a display manufacturer, so these concepts are just that. They’re demonstrations of what its screens could maybe, possibly do in the hands of another manufacturer. But they’re still cool as hell, and they were very popular with MWC attendees who had to constantly be told to stop trying to touch them. That was especially true of this Switch-style portable gaming handheld mockup, which opens fully flat and folds in half for storage when you’re done playing.

Nothing’s Phone 3A and 3A Pro use AI to organize all your stuff
257598_Nothing_Phone_3a_and_3a_Pro_AJohnson_0005
The Nothing 3A phones were just announced with a new take on the company’s “make tech more fun again” ethos. These devices have improved hardware over the Phone 2A, updated cameras, and a new feature called the Essential Space to store and index your miscellaneous screenshots, voice memos, and photographs, all through a dedicated button. Starting at $379 for the 3A and $459 for the 3A Pro, they offer solid specs for their midrange prices — and a look at what Nothing has been working on for this AI-centric moment.

The 3A and 3A Pro are mainly differentiated by their cameras, which you’ll notice just by glancing at the two devices. The 3A Pro’s prominent round camera housing includes a 3x periscope telephoto lens; the 3A offers a standard 2x zoom. Both phones include a 50-megapixel f/1.8 main camera and an 8-megapixel ultrawide. The telephoto cameras on each use a 50-megapixel sensor for lossless crop zoom: 4x for the 3A and 6x for the 3A Pro.

I love a ridiculously oversized calculator.The Lenovo ThinkBook Flip concept has another fun trick up it’s sleeve besides its foldable display. Its trackpad has hidden LED icons built into it, allowing you to summon three layers of controls and handy shortcuts.
My favorite was using it as a number pad and calling up the calculator app on the laptop’s giant 18.1-inch screen, but it has other (more useful) features too — including custom user-defined ones.

Deutsche Telekom is building a new Perplexity chatbot-powered “AI Phone,” the companies announced at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona today. The new device will be revealed later this year and run “Magenta AI,” which gives users access to Perplexity Assistant, Google Cloud AI, ElevenLabs, Picsart, and a suite of AI tools.

The AI phone concept was first revealed at MWC 2024 by Deutsche Telekom (T-Mobile’s parent company) as an “app-less” device primarily controlled by voice that can do things like book flights and make restaurant reservations. The capabilities are like those promised by “large action model” products, including the Rabbit R1. In a press release, Deutsche Telekom board member Claudia Nemat says the forthcoming AI phone with Perplexity Assistant can book a taxi and do your shopping without having to switch apps on your phone.

You spin me right round, baby, right round.Never mind rotating smartwatch crowns, rotating cameras rings are the next frontier. Nubia’s Focus 2 Ultra has a spinning dial around its rear camera, and it’s actually functional: it controls the phone’s camera zoom. It’s surprisingly easy to rotate with one finger while you’re holding the phone in portrait, and is a gimmick I’d probably end up using.

Infinix’s new concepts use solar power to charge your phone
DSC09782_processed
Chinese phone brand Infinix is known to show off a flashy concept, and at this year’s MWC the company is looking skyward for inspiration. It’s showing a phone with an integrated solar panel on the back, as well as a solar charging phone case. They’re both in the concept phase, but the demo units I saw at MWC were functional and the idea is plenty appealing.

Infinix calls this SolarEnergy-Reserving technology, and it uses perovskite solar cells like Anker’s beach umbrella and cloak concept. These cells are thinner and cheaper to produce than traditional silicon solar cells. That’s paired with a system that helps regulate voltage called Maximum Power Point Tracking. The idea is to maximize power while managing heat; sitting under a hot sun might be good for solar cells, but it’s generally not great if you want to keep your phone from overheating. As it exists now, this technology can charge a phone at up to 2W, and is intended to pad out a phone’s reserved charge while it’s not in use.

Lenovo’s ThinkBook Flip puts an extra-tall folding display on a laptop
257550_Lenovo_MWC_AJohnson_0009
Lenovo has another funky experiment it’s announcing at Mobile World Congress: the ThinkBook “codename Flip” AI PC Concept. It’s a productivity / business laptop with a flexible display, allowing it to be used as a traditional 13.1-inch clamshell, a folded-up 12.9-inch tablet, or a laptop with an extra-tall 18.1-inch vertical screen.

The ThinkBook Flip uses the same OLED panel as the $3,500 ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 that’s expected to arrive sometime in June — only here, it’s set up to fold behind the main portion of the screen instead of extend out from underneath it. That means there are no motors, which could bring costs down, and none of the display is left sitting unused inside the chassis — hence the Flip’s 0.4 inches of extra screen real estate over the Gen 6.

Lenovo is throwing ideas at the wall with new modular accessories for the magnetic Magic Bay connector of its ThinkBook 16P Gen 6 laptop. At Mobile World Congress 2025, the company announced four different proof-of-concept add-ons that may or may not ever be released, and they’re as cool as they are quirky:

There aren’t many details on the concepts yet, though the 2nd Display and Dual Display are the most straightforward. They’re meant for people who want a mobile multimonitor setup that doesn’t require a secondary device to plug in or keep charged. The 2nd Display is like attaching an 8-inch iPad Mini to your laptop, with a vertical orientation that could be great for social feeds and communication apps like Slack or Microsoft Teams. It has a panel with a 1920 x 1200-pixel resolution and 60Hz, which is plenty of resolution for a small screen.

First, we have the newest 13.3-inch ThinkPad X13, now Gen 6, that sits as Lenovo’s ultraportable slim business laptop. This time, Lenovo managed to reduce its weight even further from 2.25 pounds on the Gen 5 to just 2.05 pounds (although it could get heavier in some configurations). In comparison, Apple’s lightest M3 MacBook Air weighs 2.7 pounds.

I also have for you a new repairable laptop, a spiffy new mobile version of Photoshop, the coolest and strangest camera I’ve seen in a while, good explainers on app development and content moderation, and much more. Plus, the second part of our two-part exploration of all your favorite music gear. I’m psyched. Let’s do it.

(As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips. What do you want to know more about? What awesome tricks do you know that everyone else should? What app should everyone be using?

The Drop
The Framework Laptop 12. All my PC gamer friends are more excited about the Framework Desktop, but I think the company’s cheapest (and best-looking) laptop is going to be one to watch. There’s still a lot we don’t know about this thing, but I hope I get to recommend it to a lot of folks this year.
Photoshop for iPhone. For the first time, there’s a mobile version of Photoshop that actually feels like Photoshop. This is not entirely a good thing — there’s a lot going on in this app — and Adobe is awfully late to the game here, but a super-powered image editor is always a welcome thing on smartphones.
Flashes for Bluesky. What if Bluesky, but Instagram? That’s the whole idea behind this app, which reskins Bluesky to be much more visual and image-heavy, and gives you a way to quickly post photos (with filters!) of your own. This is the kind of open social stuff I just love.
Claude 3.7. I’m still hearing all the time about how much more people like Claude than ChatGPT or Gemini, and this new model is fascinating. “Deep research” is all the rage right now, but Claude now lets you decide how deep, and thus how slow, it’ll be.
The Sigma BF. In terms of features and usability, there’s no way this is the best $2,000 camera you can buy. But on pure aesthetic appeal, I’m not sure anything is beating this blocky, beautiful, ultra-simplified camera.
Monster Hunter Wilds. It’s only February, and this is already getting a lot of Game of the Year buzz — there are a lot of new mechanics to get used to, but it appears to be very much worth the six-year wait.
Beeper Beta. I won’t lie, I kind of forgot about Beeper. But it’s back and starting to ship again; the new Mac app is basically the old Texts.com app with a new color scheme, but the iOS app appears to be totally new. (Android, meanwhile, remains the best platform for Beeper by a mile.)
John Oliver on Facebook and content moderation. I always love John Oliver, but this is particularly great: thoughtful and smart on Section 230, the challenges and politics of content moderation, and much more. Also, don’t miss the Last Week Tonight guide to making yourself less valuable to Meta.
“Why Are There So Many iOS-Only Apps?” An extremely good answer to an extremely Installer-y question! (And one I’ve been looking into recently, as well.) To all of you who are annoyed there aren’t more Android-first apps in here: I’m with you, and here’s why.
Group project
Last week, we talked about our favorite music apps. Turns out we all love Plexamp, tolerate Spotify, and would love to have a better way to catalog and share our own music collections. This week: gear. So many of you reached out wanting to share your favorite speakers, headphones, DACs, receivers, RCA cables, and everything else that I figured I’d try and lay out some of the most popular stuff in my inbox.

First, the big and (maybe) obvious takeaway is that y’all love Sonos gear. The vast majority of people who reached out said that the best thing you can buy for a budding music setup is a great pair of stereo speakers, and most of you started with Sonos. For all its app woes, it seems there’s still no beating Sonos’ combination of sound quality and connectivity. That said, I did also get some great alternative recommendations:

A bunch of folks recommended various Edifier speakers, across the whole range of products. They’re nice, and y’all seem to like their stuff from the cheapest Bluetooth models to the highest-end pro gear.
I would never in a million years have guessed how many people would tell me they have, and love, HomePods and HomePod Minis. I heard from so many people who bought them on one sale and are thrilled with the results.
I also heard a bunch about the KEF LSX, a set of really nice-looking speakers that work wirelessly or wired, with Chromecast and AirPlay, and are exactly the kind of versatile bookshelf speakers I’ve been looking for. I’m going to end up buying these.
Lots of “just buy a soundbar” responses, too! The Vizio soundbar got some love, but I heard from a few people that practically any soundbar will be a huge upgrade to your living room audio system. I tend to agree.
For headphones, there surprisingly wasn’t a clear winner. But there were a few models that came up a lot: The Sony MDR-7506, the Sennheiser HD 600, the Sony WF-C510, the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro, the Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2E, and the Bose QuietComfort. There are also plenty of AirPods Pro fans out there, too.

I got a lot of receiver and amp recommendations — it’s definitely the second upgrade, after a good set of speakers, that most people bring into their setup — but only one brand came up more than once. A lot of folks love their WiiM Ultras for combining digital and analog music, the WiiM Mini seems to be a must-have for folks with older stereo gear, and the WiiM Amp Pro is the centerpiece of a lot of your setups. I’ve never really used WiiM stuff, but I’m going to have to change that.

Some other notes from my inbox:

Turntables are so back. Audio Technica seems to be the go-to brand, but I also heard good things about the U-Turn Audio Orbit and all of Pro-Ject’s gear.
I am convinced that every single person who owns a Sony Walkman emailed me to tell me they love it. I believe you! I kind of want one now. There are also a lot of iPod restorers out there, and one person who shared the coolest-looking CD player I’ve ever seen.
There is a strong preference for streaming audio over Chromecast Audio, rather than AirPlay, Bluetooth, or anything else. The quality is better, and a bunch of you told me it’s more reliable and better synced across speakers.
A few of you told me about home systems you’ve built with Raspberry Pis, the HiFiBerry converter, and the HiFiBerryOS. Sounds like a relatively straightforward and extremely fun project.
Thank you again to everyone who reached out and contributed to our group project the last few weeks — I read every email, Signal message, and social post, and I learned so much from all of you. We’ll have to do more music stuff soon, too, since I’ve really only scratched the surface here. Stay tuned!

Screen share
I am, both by virtue of my job and my particular brand of strangeness, always scouring the internet for people’s tech setups. I think I’m just permanently convinced that I’m One Weird Trick away from my whole life being perfect, sane, and organized, you know?

When I came across a semi-viral Threads post showing a really clever iPhone setup that made heavy use of Shortcuts and Focus modes, I immediately needed to know more. I’ve never been able to really figure out Focus modes in particular, and I wanted to see if this was the key. So I reached out to its creator, Colin, who goes by the username Tinyblocks. I asked Colin to share their own setup to see what else I might learn. So here’s Colin’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps they use and why:

Five different homescreens from a single phone.
Colin’s home screen, in five parts.
The phone: I’m using an iPhone 15.

The wallpaper: The minimal wallpaper I use is designed to blend with the dock for a cleaner look. It’s created by another Notion creator, the Digital Minimalist.

The apps: Gmail, Slack, Figma, Google Drive, Google Sheets, WhatsApp, Telegram, LinkedIn, Messenger, Discord, Instagram, X, Threads, Circle, Skool, Gumroad, YouTube, Google Maps, Naver, KorailTalk, Kakao T, Booking, Airbnb, Naver Papago, Translate, HappyCow, Revolut, Salad, KH Online, Wallet, Indy, AutoEntrepreneur, Binance, Finary, Bankin’.

After seeing how many people were interested in my dock setup, I created a free detailed guide that’s available on my Gumroad.

The core of my setup uses Focus modes and Shortcuts. I’ve created custom Focus modes, each with a dedicated page containing only relevant apps. For example, my Travel mode has maps, translation apps, Airbnb, and booking apps; Finance mode has banking apps and expense trackers. Each Focus mode has customized notifications to minimize distractions.

I replaced the default dock apps with four shortcuts to my main Focus modes, allowing me to transform my phone’s setup with just one tap. For apps I use across all modes, I utilize the Today View (left swipe) with widgets and shortcuts to apps like Messages, Photos, Gmail, Notion, Claude, Arc, and SyncTask.

I also asked Colin to share a few things they’re into right now. Here’s what they shared:

Productivity tools, especially Notion (I’m working on becoming a Notion creator).
Learning Korean (I’m living in Korea currently). It’s challenging but rewarding. I have a private lesson once a week. As I’m a huge Notion nerd, I’ve created my own setup there to track vocabulary and grammar rules.
My nerdy side comes out with audiobooks, particularly anything by Brandon Sanderson. Right now I’m listening to his Secret Project books. My favorite series from him is the Wax & Wayne series (Mistborn Era 2).
I recently started a consistent gym routine and am really enjoying it. I began with a few PT classes to get started, and now I’m following my trainer’s recommended plan for the next few weeks. I’ll probably end up making my own gym planner (in Notion, of course).
Crowdsourced
Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week.

“We started using Huckleberry right away to track our baby’s eating, diapers, sleeping, and even my wife’s pumping, and we probably haven’t grazed the surface of what the app offers. Super helpful to simply make sure your baby has eaten enough and has soiled enough diapers plus much more! I also work for a sales company that uses Salesforce to log everything, and it definitely takes practice to get used to it, so this is great practice!” — Spencer

“I’ve recently paired up my Keys-To-Go 2 with my Boox Poke 3 and it’s a perfect coffee shop set-up for distractionless writing.” — Jeroen

“Starting to watch the third season of Industry, the Max series about a group of hungry, young graduates competing for a limited number of permanent positions at Pierpoint & Co., a leading bank in London.” — Rob

“I’ve been diving into the world of e-readers this week and just made the switch from Kindle to a Kobo Clara BW. It’s the perfect handheld size with clear text and an auto warm light that makes reading sessions at night so easy. It’s like a smaller Paperwhite. But what I’ve really enjoyed are the thoughtful software touches that bring elements of physical books to e-readers, like the ability to digitally ‘dog-ear’ a page by folding the corner! Such a nice touch!” — Ian

“ChessUp 2. The board allows you to play chess against the computer, and it can also provide assistance to one or both of the players during a 1v1 game. The board and pieces feel really high quality, and give a satisfying soft and pleasant sound when you move them. The lights coming from the board give the whole experience a very cool feel that reminds me of the 3D chess in Star Wars episode IV.” — Thomas

“Learning how to prove you’re not an AI, and the future of content verification with C2PA.” — Colin

“Saw the Anybox mention in the latest Installer as a way to capture links and notes, but a AAA tip for you or your readers: it’s also a fantastic way to capture images across any Apple device and categorize them for later. From cool game shots to retro print ads to memes that express any emotion, it’s been essential to my work Slack responses.” — Ryan

“Watched this documentary on NHK about the creator of the manga Detective Conan. This shows what people do for the love of the art” — Gigg

“I was able to join the alpha for Deta Surf and it’s one of the strangest and most interesting web browsers I’ve ever used. It’s absolutely brimming with personality. It feels more like a weird experiment than a browser in some ways at the moment, but I love seeing this kind of creativity in the software space.” — Luke"
2025-03-01T00:12:50Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/622080/mozilla-revising-firefox-terms-of-use-data,"Mozilla is revising its new Terms of Use for Firefox introduced on Wednesday following criticisms over language that seemed to give the company broad ownership over user data. With the change, “we’re updating the language to more clearly reflect the limited scope of how Mozilla interacts with user data,” the company says in a Friday post.

The particular language that drew criticism was:

When you upload or input information through Firefox, you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use that information to help you navigate, experience, and interact with online content as you indicate with your use of Firefox.

That language has been removed. Now, the language in the terms says:


You give Mozilla the rights necessary to operate Firefox. This includes processing your data as we describe in the Firefox Privacy Notice. It also includes a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license for the purpose of doing as you request with the content you input in Firefox. This does not give Mozilla any ownership in that content.

“We’ve been listening to some of our community’s concerns with parts of the TOU, specifically about licensing,” the company says. “Our intent was just to be as clear as possible about how we make Firefox work, but in doing so we also created some confusion and concern.”

RelatedMozilla says its new Firefox terms don’t give it ownership of your data
Friday’s post additionally provides some context about why the company has “stepped away from making blanket claims that ‘We never sell your data.’” Mozilla says that “in some places, the LEGAL definition of ‘sale of data’ is broad and evolving,”and that “the competing interpretations of do-not-sell requirements does leave many businesses uncertain about their exact obligations and whether or not they’re considered to be ‘selling data.’”

Mozilla says that “there are a number of places where we collect and share some data with our partners” so that Firefox can be “commercially viable,” but it adds that it spells those out in its privacy notice and works to strip data of potentially identifying information or share it in aggregate.

Friday’s post follows an update added to the original Wednesday announcement to try and clarify things."
2025-03-01T00:54:59Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/622102/lenovo-thinkpad-x13-gen-6-t14s-2-in-1-laptops-mwc,"Lenovo may have some cool new flippy-screened and solar-powered laptops it’s showing off at Mobile World Congress this year, but it’s also announcing the generational notebook updates you’ll actually be able to buy within the coming months. Some of the new models include a redesigned and super lightweight ThinkPad X13 notebook, the first T-Series convertible 2-in-1 with the ThinkPad T14s, and a refreshed ThinkBook 16p workstation.

First, we have the newest 13.3-inch ThinkPad X13, now Gen 6, that sits as Lenovo’s ultraportable slim business laptop. This time, Lenovo managed to reduce its weight even further from 2.25 pounds on the Gen 5 to just 2.05 pounds (although it could get heavier in some configurations). In comparison, Apple’s lightest M3 MacBook Air weighs 2.7 pounds.


Lenovo is also adding AMD Ryzen AI Pro 300-series processor options alongside Intel (up to Core Ultra 7). You can configure the X13 with up to 64GB LPDDR5 RAM and 2TB SSD and a replaceable battery option of either 41Wh or 54.7Wh.

The Lenovo ThinkPad X13 Gen 6 will be available in North America starting June 2025, with an expected starting price of $1,139.

Next, Lenovo is turning its T14s notebook it announced last year into a 2-in-1. It has a 14-inch WUXGA touchscreen with up to 500 nits of brightness, and you can configure the device with up to an Intel Core Ultra 7, 64GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage.

The T14s comes with an option for a Wi-Fi 7 upgrade and optional 5G connectivity, plus there’s a user-replaceable 58Wh battery. Ports include two Thunderbolt 4, two 5Gbps USB-A, HDMI 2.1, ethernet, SIM, and an audio jack.

The Lenovo ThinkPad T14s 2-in-1 will be available in North America starting June 2025, with an expected starting price of $1,719. The notebook version will launch alongside the 2-in-1 and will start at $1,674.

Lenovo is also announcing a (not for North America) new desktop replacement ThinkBook 16p Gen 6 that has a high 180W system TDP that can boost to 200W in “Geek Mode.” With that energy, the laptop can power its discrete NPU, up to Intel Core Ultra 9 mobile processors and Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 GPU, and up to 64GB DDR5 RAM for AI tasks, rendering, and more. For ports, it has two Thunderbolt 4, two 5Gbps USB-A, one 10Gbps USB-A, HDMI 2.1, an SD card reader, a SIM slot, and an audio jack. It also has a 16-inch 3.2K IPS display, Wi-Fi 7, and a fingerprint reader.

Finally, in May, Lenovo will launch the ThinkPad T14 Gen 6 and T16 Gen 4 (both with Ryzen Pro AI 300 or Intel Core Ultra) in North America, with prices expected to be $1,359 and $1,623, respectively. And sometime in Q2 this year, it will launch the affordable ThinkPad E14 Gen 7 for $849 and E16 Gen 3 for $859 as well as the ThinkBook 14 2-in-1 Gen 5 for $1,374."
2025-03-01T04:00:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/trump-touts-resources-deal-with-zelenskiy-as-pathway-to-peace,"The US and Ukraine failed to sign a critical minerals agreement after a Friday meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskiy devolved into a fiery exchange, fracturing relations between the two countries.

Trump took umbrage with Zelenskiy’s doubts that the US president’s efforts to broker a deal with Russia would lead to lasting peace. The Ukrainian leader departed the White House following the public spat, and a planned signing ceremony and press conference were canceled.

US officials said the minerals deal — which Trump had cast as a necessary step to repay American support as he sought to negotiate an end to the war directly with Russia’s Vladimir Putin — was not signed before Zelenskiy’s departure.

“He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace,” Trump said in a social media post shortly before Zelenskiy left the White House.

The clash, played in front of the television cameras, is a major setback for Zelenskiy, who was hoping the in-person meeting with Trump would help smooth out his relations with the American president and commit him to stronger backing for his country following his tilt toward Moscow.


Instead, the vicious tone of the exchange is likely to sow further doubt about Ukraine’s ability to stand up to Russia’s three-year invasion as it struggles with manpower on the battlefield and still relies heavily on US military aid. It’s also likely to alarm European allies, who have already been scrambling to fill the void being left by Washington.

The Ukrainian leader angered Trump and US Vice President JD Vance when he said he did not believe the planned deal would do enough to deter further Russian aggression.

“Putin will never stop and will go further and further,” Zelenskiy said, adding that the Russian leader “hates Ukrainians” and wanted to destroy the country. “We can do it, but it’s not enough,” he added of the deal.

As Zelenskiy sought to make his point, Trump and Vance lit into the the beleaguered leader, suggesting his approach — delivered in the Oval Office — was disrespectful and inhibiting an end to the bloody three-year war.

“It’s going to be very hard to do business like this,” Trump said, telling Zelenskiy he was not sure the Ukrainian leader could make a deal. “You’ve got to be more thankful, because let me tell you, you don’t have the cards. With us, you have the cards, but without us you don’t have any cards.”

WATCH: Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy left the White House Friday without signing a minerals deal with the US.
“You’re gambling with World War III,” Trump continued. “And what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country — this country — that’s backed you far more than a lot of people said they should,” he said. “You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out, and if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it is going to be pretty.”

The meeting had been intended as a moment of unity between the leaders, who were set to sign the natural resources agreement, which was designed to satisfy Trump’s concerns that US aid would not be repaid. Trump had touted the agreement as a major commitment from the US to Ukraine as he initially welcomed Zelenskiy to the White House for a high-stakes meeting with stark implications for the fight to repel Russia’s invasion.


“It’s a pathway to peace. It’s a pathway to getting something solved,” Trump said.

Trump is back. What does that mean for the economy?
The deal, however, did not offer the explicit security guarantees Zelenskiy had wanted, instead focusing on the economic partnership between the US and Ukraine. Zelenskiy told Trump that Putin had repeatedly violated previous agreements and that Ukraine would never accept a simple ceasefire to conclude the war. He insisted to Trump that the mineral deal was not enough to ensure Ukraine’s security.

Public Clash
The underlying tension between the leaders was obvious. Trump had his eyes closed and was tapping his fingers as Zelenskiy stressed his concerns about Putin reneging on an agreement. When Trump downplayed the threat of a future attack, the Ukrainian leader shook his head.

“I’m in the middle. I want to solve this thing. I’m for both,” Trump insisted. “It’s wonderful to speak badly about somebody else, but I want to get it solved.”

Then the meeting exploded when Vance, sitting nearby, criticized Zelenskiy’s approach.

“Do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that’s trying to prevent the destruction of your country?” Vance asked.

Trump said Zelenskiy had “tremendous hatred” for Putin and suggested that the anger could be inhibiting a deal, while also defending his warm relations with the Russian leader as more likely to yield results.


“I could be tougher than any human being you’ve ever seen. I’d be so tough, but you’re never going to get it done that way,” Trump said.

The leaders also sparred after Zelenskiy suggested Trump did not understand the issue because the US was protected by an ocean, and didn’t face the looming threat from Russia.

“You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good. We’re going to feel very good and very strong. You’re right now not in a very good position. You’ve allowed yourself to be in a very bad position,” Trump said.

“Have you said thank you once?” Vance added. The vice president went on to suggest Zelenskiy had campaigned for former Vice President Kamala Harris with his trip last fall to an ammunition plant in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.

“Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country,” Vance admonished.

After leaving the White House, Zelenskiy in a post to social media thanked Trump, Congress and “the American people.”

“Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that,” he wrote.

Minerals Deal
The fate of the natural resources deal remained in doubt as the meeting broke.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview on Bloomberg Television that he did not know what Zelenskiy could do to get the agreement back on track, saying he had commited “one of the great diplomatic own goals in history.”

Bessent said it would be up to Trump to decide whether he wants to continue negotiating with Zelenskiy.

“President Trump’s idea was to show that way with the economic deals, to show that we’re more intertwined. And that would be a symbol to the Ukrainian people, to Russian leadership and to the American people and President Zelenskiy blew that up today,” Bessent added. “I’m not sure what he was thinking.”

Speaking from the White House after the meeting, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of the president’s, also sought to lay the blame for the Oval Office blow up on Zelenskiy, saying Trump had been “shocked” by their exchange and questioning whether the US could work with the Ukrainian leader again.

“I don’t know that we can ever do business with Zelenskiy again,” Graham said. “He either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.”

The US president Friday originally called the minerals deal an “exciting moment” and said funds from the deal could also be used for artificial intelligence and military weapons. He reiterated that he would continue military sales to Ukraine.

“We don’t know exactly how much because we’re going to be putting some money in a fund that we’re going to get from the raw earth that we’re going to be taking and sharing in terms of revenues, so it’s going to be a lot of money,” he said.

Still, Trump has downplayed calls for more explicit security guarantees, suggesting the economic ties between Ukraine and the US would suffice to deter Putin from further aggression.

“I think once we make the agreement, that’s going to be 95% of it, it’s not going to go back to fighting,” Trump said. “I’ve spoken with President Putin, and I think, I mean, I feel very strong. I’ve known him for a long time, and I feel very strongly that they’re very serious about it.”

“I’m not worried about security, I’m worried about getting the deal done,” the president added.

Zelenskiy’s visit capped a dramatic week that saw both French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visit Washington to push Trump to offer US support for a European “backstop” to protect Ukraine from further attacks.


France and the UK have discussed deploying a peacekeeping force but any such initiative will require US assistance, but Trump has declined to provide any assurances of US support and cast it as an issue for Europe to deal with."
2025-03-01T15:35:07Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/621957/samsung-galaxy-a56-a36-a26-launch-mwc,"Samsung is bringing even more AI to its line of budget-friendly phones. The new Galaxy A56, A36, and A26 now come with what the company calls “awesome intelligence,” enabling an array of new AI-powered image editing features already available with Samsung’s pricier S25 lineup.

One of these features is Best Face, an AI tool that lets you swap the facial expressions of up to five people in a motion photo in case someone blinks or looks away from the camera. It’s similar to Google Pixel’s Best Take and launched with the Galaxy S25 in January.

There’s an “improved” object removal tool and photo filters, along with Google’s Circle to Search feature that allows you to search for text and images just by circling it on your screen. (Samsung added Circle to Search to select A-series devices last August.) The phones will also support up to six years of Android OS and security upgrades, which is longer than what Samsung previously offered for the previous generation.

Besides new AI features, Samsung made some small design tweaks to each phone as well. In addition to an oval-shaped rear camera housing, all three devices now have the same 6.7-inch full HD Plus display with an up to 120Hz refresh rate, as opposed to the smaller 6.6-inch screen on the A55 and A35 and 6.5 inches on the A25. The A56 comes with the same 12MP ultrawide sensor, 50MP main camera, and 5MP macro camera. It also has a 12MP selfie shooter (which is lower than the A55’s 32MP front-facing sensor).

Though the A56 comes with an upgraded Exynos 1580 chip, the A36 has a last-gen Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chip. All three A-series devices have a 5,000mAh battery, but only the A56 and A36 support 45W charging and come with a “larger vapor chamber” to improve performance. Samsung has also extended IP67 dust and water resistance to the A26 for the first time. The phones will ship with Android 15 and come in a range of colors that vary by device.

The Galaxy A26 gets a slightly larger 6.7-inch display, too.
At $499, the Galaxy A56 is the most expensive of the bunch and will launch in the US “later this year.” The A36 will be available on March 26th exclusively at Best Buy starting at $399, while the A26 will cost $299 when it launches on March 28th. The Galaxy A56, A36, and A26 will also be available for purchase in the UK on March 19th for £499, £399, and £299, respectively."

Additionally, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max provides access to a wide selection of streaming apps and Dolby Atmos, allowing for more immersive audio. It offers broad HDR support — including support for Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus — and works impressively well with Alexa, to the point where you can make commands as specific as “Alexa, turn to ESPN on Sling TV” via the included Alexa remote. Admittedly, the interface is too Prime-centric for some of us at The Verge, but hey, they can’t all be as slick as Google’s TV Streamer.

All eyes were on Framework’s 4.5-liter gaming desktop this week, but if you could care less for customizable aesthetics and AMD’s Strix Halo, Apple’s M4 Mac Mini is on sale at Amazon with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage starting at $557 ($42 off). The step-up M4 Pro model offers faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet; however, the compact entry-level configuration remains a fantastic value with outstanding performance and plenty of I/O.

Nomad’s annual Overstock Sale is in full effect, giving you a chance to save up to 70 percent on chargers, cables, cases, and a variety of other goods through Monday, March 3rd. Personally, I’m partial to the Modern Leather Foio case for the iPhone 16 (now $49 $70) and the second-gen Stand One charger (now $88 $110), the latter of which features a hefty metal-and-glass design and can provide up to 15W of power to MagSafe-equipped iPhones. That being said, Nomad is also discounting a ton of “vintage” accessories, meaning you’re in luck if you’ve been holding out for a premium leather case for your *checks notes* Google Pixel 4.
I’ve been eagerly awaiting Thomas Ricker’s review of the forthcoming Aurzen Zip, which is still available on Kickstarter for $299 ($100 off) thanks to early bird pricing. The tri-fold projector — which is slated to launch later this month — can mirror your iPhone or Android device in portrait or landscape orientation, yet it’s compact enough that you can place it just about anywhere. It also offers 100 lumens of brightness and up to 80 minutes of battery life, though, sadly, it can’t stream from services like Netflix, Disney Plus, or Amazon Prime due to DRM restrictions."
2025-03-02T14:29:07Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/622406/xiaomi-15-ultra-pad-7-launch-europe-price-mwc,"Just days after revealing the 15 Ultra in China, Xiaomi has announced a UK and European launch for its latest flagship phone, together with the base Xiaomi 15. There’s no sign of the Pro model, but there is an array of tablets, earbuds, and fitness trackers appearing alongside the phones.

The 15 and 15 Ultra are available to order today, starting at £1,299 / €1,499 (around $1,600) for the Ultra and £899 / €999 (around $1,100) for the 15. Both are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite and include big batteries, fast wired and wireless charging, and IP68 ratings.

The cameras are really where the two phones diverge. While both phones feature similar-sounding sets of 50-megapixel main, telephoto, and ultrawide cameras, the Ultra actually uses different sensors on every lens, so it should net superior results. It also features a fourth lens: a 200-megapixel, 4.3x periscope lens that dominates the already large camera module on the phone’s back. Xiaomi is also selling a Photography Kit add-on for £179 (around $225), which includes a functional camera grip accessory complete with a shutter button, zoom lever, and exposure dial.


The two phones are joined by the Xiaomi Pad 7 and Pad 7 Pro, a pair of 11.2-inch Android tablets with 3.2K 144Hz displays. The two tablets are similarly specced, but the Pro model uses a faster Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chip (compared to a 7 Plus Gen 3 on the 7) and has higher resolution cameras. They go on sale for £369 /€399 (around $465) and £449 / €499 ($565), respectively. The Pro also ships in a “Matte Glass” version, which should offer reduced screen glare for £549 / €649 ($690).


Xiaomi has also announced European releases for the Buds 5 Pro, which come in a Bluetooth model and a separate Wi-Fi version for improved quality when paired with a compatible Xiaomi phone, which, for the moment, is only the 15 and 15 Ultra. Finally, there are two wearables, too: the Smart Band 9 Pro features improved health tracking compared to last year’s model, while the Watch S4 is a simple smartwatch that features a return of the swappable bezels introduced this time last year in the Watch S3."
2025-03-02T15:09:10Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/622443/hmd-amped-earbuds-battery-case-qi2-charging,"HMD announced a new set of earbuds today with a case that doubles as a backup phone battery. The aptly named wireless Amped Buds come in a Qi2 charging case that uses reverse wireless charging to boost your phone’s charge. With a slim design and a 1,600mAh battery, it’s a portable case that offers just enough charge to get through the end of the day. They’re priced at €199 (about $206) and will launch in April. We don’t yet know if they’ll come to the US.

The Amped Buds include active noise cancellation and environmental noise cancellation. The case is rated IPX4 for some dust resistance, and the earbuds are IP54 splash-resistant. The case measures 14mm thick, and the buds are designed with a hinge to fit straight into the case for charging. They’re spring loaded, so there’s a satisfying pop when you put them in or take them out of the case. Remove the buds, and you’ll fold the stems forward to fit like standard earbuds.



The Amped Buds case is portable enough.

There’s a hinge so that the buds fit straight-on into the case.

The buds pop in and out of the housing.
The case and buds are color-matched and come in cyan, black, and pink. The case’s Qi2 support means it will connect magnetically to Qi2 and MagSafe phones for a secure fit while charging. It can be used with magnetic phone cases, too, or with any plain wireless charging phone (it just won’t stick securely), and there’s a USB port to provide wired charging. Of course, you can just use the case to charge the earbuds themselves — more than ten times over, according to HMD, which gets you up to 95 hours of music playback time before you have to charge the case again.

It’s a clever concept that makes immediate sense. Plenty of us are used to charging and carrying earpods already, so there’s no new behavior to learn. You just carry your earbuds with you as usual, and if you happen to run low on battery, you have a back-up on hand, or you just have a huge battery to keep recharging your buds. Pretty slick.

HMD announced the buds at MWC where it also unveiled an FC Barcelona-branded phone and a safety-focused phone for teens developed with kids’ smartwatch maker Xplora. But the earbuds stand out to me as the most interesting new offering."
2025-03-02T16:11:37Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/622465/siris-real-ai-upgrade-could-still-be-years-away,"Apple Intelligence was supposed to finally deliver a more natural version of Siri, but now, people who work in Apple’s AI department believe the company won’t release a ”true modernized, conversational version of Siri … until iOS 20 at best in 2027,“ writes Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman in today’s Power On newsletter.

Apple is expected to roll out an LLM-powered Siri upgrade in iOS 18.5, but Gurman says this will work as its own separate model from the old Siri, a system that “doesn’t work as smoothly as it could.” According to Gurman, the modernized Siri would merge the two into a new architecture that can handle both simple requests, like setting timers, and the advanced AI-powered abilities Apple showed off last year, like carrying out tasks across apps using context like personal details and what’s on your screen. Apple planned to introduce this combined Siri architecture in iOS 19.4, but it’s “running behind” and “won’t be unveiled in June,” when the company usually holds WWDC, Gurman writes.

Amazon reportedly struggled with its own AI assistant upgrade of Alexa; Amazon head of Devices and Services Panos Panay told my colleague Jennifer Tuohy that the new Alexa Plus system has involved a “hundred percent re-architected” system that blends the old Alexa with the new. That’s now coming in early access soon, though only to certain devices.

Apple is on the same path but with extra challenges. Gurman reports that people in Apple’s AI department say its models “are reaching their limits,” but the company has had a hard time securing the AI training hardware it needs to improve things. At the same time, he writes that the department has been plagued by “ineffective leadership” and workers defecting to rivals, all while those rivals seem to be pushing farther and farther ahead."
2025-03-02T18:01:57Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/622502/faa-orders-staff-find-funding-starlink-verizon-deal,"Officials at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday ordered staff “to begin finding tens of millions of dollars for a Starlink deal” to upgrade air traffic control communications, anonymous sources have told Rolling Stone. The story follows reports that Starlink may be taking the job from Verizon, which already has a multibillion-dollar contract with the government to improve the system.

According to Rolling Stone, the talks “have mostly, if not entirely, been delivered verbally,” something its sources say is “unusual for a matter like this.” One person the outlet spoke with suggested that it looked like “someone does not want a paper trail.” Rolling Stone says it’s not clear whether the Verizon contract has ended yet, nor if any Starlink deal is official. Starlink is a subsidiary of SpaceX, which DOGE head Elon Musk owns.

RelatedStarlink poised to take over $2.4 billion contract to overhaul air traffic control communication

Referring to previous reporting in a statement issued yesterday, House Representatives Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) and James Clyburn (D-SC) called the reported deal “a glaring conflict of interest” in light of Musk’s government role at the head of DOGE, which has been directing massive, chaotic changes to federal bureaucracy. The two said the deal’s changes would represent “dangerous actions that put Elon Musk’s personal wealth over the American people’s lives.”

Musk insisted last week that Verizon’s system was “breaking down very rapidly” and putting flyers at risk. He later corrected himself, noting the Verizon system is “not yet operational” and that the one he was criticizing “was made L3 Harris.” He also claimed Starlink is providing terminals for free to “restore air traffic control connectivity.”"
2025-03-02T20:31:12Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/622380/lenovo-thinkbook-flip-concept-laptop-foldable-mwc,"Lenovo has another funky experiment it’s announcing at Mobile World Congress: the ThinkBook “codename Flip” AI PC Concept. It’s a productivity / business laptop with a flexible display, allowing it to be used as a traditional 13.1-inch clamshell, a folded-up 12.9-inch tablet, or a laptop with an extra-tall 18.1-inch vertical screen.

The ThinkBook Flip uses the same OLED panel as the $3,500 ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 that’s expected to arrive sometime in June — only here, it’s set up to fold behind the main portion of the screen instead of extend out from underneath it. That means there are no motors, which could bring costs down, and none of the display is left sitting unused inside the chassis — hence the Flip’s 0.4 inches of extra screen real estate over the Gen 6.

When folded back, the Flip can be used like a normal 13-inch clamshell laptop, albeit with nearly half its screen facing backward. You can use that rear-facing portion to mirror or extend your display and present to someone else without the need for an external monitor or projector, or just leave it blank. But the real star of the show is when you flip the screen up to get all 18.1 inches / 2000 x 2664 resolution of glorious OLED for yourself. In addition to being able to view long documents and websites, it puts the webcam and top portion of the screen at a pleasing and neck-relieving eye level.



Outside of its screen, the Flip’s other unique feature is its Smart ForcePad trackpad. It offers three color-coded layers of LED-illuminated touch shortcuts and media controls you can call up within the pad itself. They can transform the trackpad into a number pad, offer shortcuts to functions like the Snipping Tool or a mute button for your mic, or serve as an app launcher. Samuel Shang, principal researcher of Lenovo Research, told me the company’s dream setup would be to replace the touchpad with a smartphone display, but that would be too costly. The basic illuminated icons offered a fair compromise.

While the Flip is still in the concept phase, Lenovo does have some estimated specs for what would go inside, which seems like a promising sign this laptop will actually come to market. It’ll use an Intel Ultra 7 processor, 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM, PCIe SSD storage, Thunderbolt 4 ports, and feature a fingerprint reader.

The ThinkBook Flip I got to see in a brief demo ahead of MWC was an early prototype that still felt fragile and a little rough around the edges. It was far from the ready-to-ship rollable ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 I saw at CES, which I didn’t have to treat so delicately. But my colleague Allison Johnson saw another prototype of the Flip in Barcelona at MWC that already looked a little further along and less janky.

There’s always a chance that this concept never goes beyond the prototype phase, but since it’s borrowing components from the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6, the odds may be in its favor. The Flip may make sense as an alternate offering if its lack of motors means it can be offered at a lower price than its rollable cousin. I know I personally always want to see more funky laptops, and it’d be cool to get multiple flavors of these tall boys."
2025-03-02T20:52:09Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/622538/trump,"In a pair of social media posts today, President Donald Trump named some cryptocurrencies he says will be part of a Crypto Strategic Reserve being created by an executive order he signed in January. Those include Bitcoin and Ether, which he says “will be the heart of the Reserve.”
Trump said in the first of his two Truth Social posts that his order “directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve” that also includes XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Trump hinted at such a reserve on the campaign trail, telling attendees of a crypto conference last year that the US would never sell its Bitcoin holdings.

Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has quickly backed away from the wary stance toward cryptocurrencies it held prior to Trump’s inauguration this year. The agency has recently dropped multiple investigations and lawsuits against cryptocurrency firms that alleged securities violations.
One of the currencies Trump mentioned today, Ripple’s XRP, was the subject of a 2020 SEC lawsuit in which a judge ruled that it functioned as an unregistered security, but only when Ripple sold it to institutional investors. The SEC appealed that decision in October last year; as of this writing, that appeal is ongoing."
2025-03-03 13:00:03+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/economy/housing/are-homes-values-about-to-fall-it-depends-on-the-location-f61e8ea5,"Stark regional differences are opening up in the housing market. Buyers have the power to demand big price cuts in some parts of the country, but still face bidding wars in others. 

The national supply of homes for sale hasn’t returned to normal yet. In January, U.S. existing-home inventories were 16% below levels seen this time five years ago, according to the National Association of Realtors. Homeowners with ultralow mortgage rates have been reluctant to sell and lose their cheap borrowing costs. But this lock-in effect is slowly loosening as more people decide they can’t delay moving any longer, so supply is increasing. 

Beneath the headline numbers, different states are recovering at sharply different paces. Inventory has shot above 2019 levels in a handful of areas. In Texas, the number of properties for sale is 20% higher than it was before the pandemic, data from Realtor.com shows. Florida and Colorado are also above 2019 levels. 
At the other end of the spectrum, supply is crunched in parts of the Northeast and Midwest. In 15 states including New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the number of homes currently on the market is still less than half what was normal before the pandemic.    

Several things are causing a two-speed housing market. One is a glut of newly built homes. Last December, builders had 118,000 ready-to-occupy single-family homes sitting unsold, according to the National Association of Home Builders—the highest level since August 2009. 
Based on permitting applications, most new construction has happened in the South, particularly in Florida and Texas. Florida expanded its housing stock by 15% since 2020, according to estimates by Brad O’Connor, chief economist at Florida Realtors. These newly built homes are hitting the market at a time when demand from buyers is exceptionally weak because mortgage rates remain high. As properties sit unsold, inventories are creeping up.  

Meanwhile, in states like Illinois, strict zoning laws and expensive building costs have hampered new construction. And the inventory of existing homes for sale is gummed up. Jeff Baker, chief executive officer of Illinois Realtors, says that although many homeowners in the state want to move, there is so little supply and prices are so inflated that people have little choice but to stay put. 

The lock-in effect of cheap mortgages is also slightly weaker in some regions than in others, which is influencing how fast homes are hitting the market. In the South, 21% of outstanding mortgages on average had a rate of 6% or higher at the third quarter of last year compared with 18% in the Northeast, based on an analysis by Chris Porter, a senior vice president at John Burns Research and Consulting. This is largely because more homes have sold in the South since interest rates rose, because of continued migration to the region. 
Homeowners in the South are also slightly more likely to own their property outright than the national average, based on 2023 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. As mortgage-free owners often don’t need to take out an expensive new home loan when they move, they have greater flexibility to sell. 

Another reason why inventories are rising fast in certain states is that properties look overvalued, so buyers aren’t biting. Thanks to a migration boom during the pandemic, property prices in some Sunbelt states rose faster than in other parts of the country. In Florida, the value of the median home increased 64% over the past five years according to Redfin, compared with 42% and 17% gains in Illinois and New York respectively. These red-hot prices, coupled with rising insurance costs, have put valuations out of whack with local wages. The average all-in cost of homeownership in a selection of major Florida metros is now equivalent to 44% of local incomes, according to the John Burns Affordability Index. This is up from 28% in 2019. As migration to Florida has slowed, there are fewer new high-wage earners to support home prices at their current levels.  

The good news for house hunters is that affordability should improve in oversupplied states. Barring a decline in mortgage rates, home prices in markets like Texas are likely to fall. This isn’t the case in many parts of the Northeast and Midwest, where strangled supply should support property prices. 

American homes look overvalued across the country, but supply is very uneven. The next phase of this strange housing market could see prices fall sharply in some areas, while continuing to rise in others."

The Arizona-based semiconductor company said Monday that the cuts will be at its Fab 4 facility in Gresham, Oregon and its Fab 5 facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado as well as at a facility in the Philippines.

On the corporate side, Microchip said it will slash jobs in various business units and support groups.

It expects to incur about $30 million to $40 million in severance and benefits costs.

The company had already been readjusting its structure. In December, Microchip said it would close its Fab 2 facility in Tempe, Arizona. It expects to shut down those manufacturing operations in May and the facility and equipment will be sold.

Microchip expects the latest cuts to save the company about $90 million to $100 million every year once fully implemented.

In its most recent quarter, the company reported net sales of $1.03 billion, down nearly 12% sequentially and down 42% from the prior-year period.

The company also swung to a third-quarter loss of $53.6 million from a profit of $419.2 million a year earlier.

At the time, Chief Executive Steve Sanghi said the company required decisive steps to realign the business in the face of declining revenue and a growing inventory backlog."
2025-03-03 13:19:38+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/health/rfk-jr-and-his-allies-target-trumps-beloved-soda-8f65b234,"WASHINGTON—Robert F. Kennedy Jr. calls it “poison.” President Trump has multiple cans of it every day. Welcome to the 2025 soda wars.

At both state and federal levels, the Kennedy-led Make America Healthy Again movement is backing efforts to prevent people from spending food-aid benefits on sugary, carbonated beverages. Now, they are gaining momentum with an administration led by a man who enjoys soda so much that he had a red button installed on his desk for a valet to bring him a Diet Coke.

Beverage companies are nervous about the push and preparing a counterpush of their own.

Liberal-leaning states including New York and Minnesota have tried in the past to strip soda from state food-aid programs, saying it would boost their nutritional impact. But the U.S. Agriculture Department, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, has rejected the requests for more than 20 years, saying it would be too complicated to implement. This year, deep-red Arkansas might be the first to get a different answer.

The state is preparing to ask the USDA if it can restrict some less-healthy items, including potentially soda, candy and desserts, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in an interview Friday.“Nobody is anti-Diet Coke. Nobody is anti-soft drink. I like a soft drink, too. It’s whether or not the government should be paying for it,” said Sanders, who was Trump’s press secretary in his first term.

Currently SNAP recipients can purchase most food with the benefits, but not items such as pet food or alcohol. Sanders said the state is still fine-tuning the language of its waiver request.

Trump’s new agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, has indicated she is inclined to grant such waivers. She sent governors a letter on her first full day in office, urging them to propose pilot programs testing changes to food aid.

“When a taxpayer is putting money into SNAP, are they OK with us using their tax dollars to feed really bad food and sugary drinks to children, who perhaps need something more nutritious?” Rollins told reporters recently outside the White House.  Meanwhile in Washington, an alarmed Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and their band of lobbyists are trying to persuade Trump such steps would alienate his core voters. The chief executive of Coca-Cola, James Quincey, spent about an hour with Trump during the transition, presenting him a commemorative inaugural Diet Coke. “Our principal objective is to make sure we offer those consumers options,” Quincey said.

The American Beverage Association, a trade group that represents soda and juice makers, commissioned polling this year showing that nearly 60% of those who voted for Trump last fall support allowing soda purchases with food aid. “The better populist path is standing with the historic working class coalition that voted for President Trump,” the group’s CEO Kevin Keane said. “There are no wins in pushing for restrictions,” he said.

The trade group launched an advertising campaign highlighting that about 60% of the drinks Americans buy from companies like Coke and PepsiCo have zero sugar.Many officials in the Trump administration support limiting soda, but Trump himself, who also drinks Diet Coke from a wine glass for toasts, has been skeptical of banning things his supporters like. He has told advisers that bans aren’t popular when others have proposed restrictions on menthol, for example. Given that dynamic, soda companies are planning a lobbying campaign focused on Trump himself, according to people familiar with the effort.

Grocers and food companies have opposed efforts to exclude soda and other sugary drinks from the assistance program, which helps more than 42 million Americans, as have antihunger groups and some Democrats. 

“This policy could work in a world where everyone has access to fresh, healthy produce where they live,” Arkansas state Sen. Clarke Tucker, a Democrat, said of the push to exclude soda. “That’s not the reality probably anywhere in America,” and certainly not in Arkansas, he said.State lawmakers in Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Texas, Wyoming and elsewhere have introduced legislation to exclude soda and in some cases other types of sugary desserts in SNAP.

“You see the movement happening with RFK Jr.—finally the topic has come to the front here,” said Arizona state Rep. Leo Biasiucci, a Republican who wrote one such bill. Biasiucci said that he was motivated after watching a family buy soda and junk food at a Circle K convenience store with SNAP benefits.

Republicans have long been divided on the issue, with some uncomfortable over the idea of policing people’s purchases. Sonny Perdue, who served as agriculture secretary under Trump’s first administration, said at the time that he didn’t want “to become a nanny state of directing how, and what, people feed their families.”

When Congress authorized a permanent food-aid program in 1964, the version passed by the U.S. House of Representatives specifically excluded soda and “luxury foods,” but the Senate removed that provision, arguing it would be too complicated to enforce.Sanders’s push to restrict soda purchases through SNAP in Arkansas is striking given her close ties with Walmart, the country’s largest grocer based in her state. Grocers and retailers have traditionally opposed measures to prevent SNAP coverage of specific foods through groups such as the National Retail Federation. More than a quarter of all SNAP benefits were spent at Walmart in the year ending in July 2024, according to data firm Numerator, which noted that over 94% of SNAP recipients shopped at Walmart in the past year.

“They’re the biggest retailer in the world, so of course they are going to talk to us and walk through concerns, and we have a very good relationship,” Sanders said in the interview. Walmart had no comment.

Sanders recently announced she plans to run for re-election in 2026, and attended the Super Bowl this year with Trump. She grew up in the state’s spotlight, the daughter of its former governor, Mike Huckabee, who chronicled his own struggles with chronic disease. In 2003, he lost more than 100 pounds after being diagnosed with diabetes.

Where it ranks in the technological Hall of Fame alongside electricity, genetics, space flight or the wheel might be beside the point for those following the stock market's embrace of the theme. AI is showing all the hallmarks of a development that unduly fascinates the public just when it has excess savings. The closest fit seems to be the 1990's tech boom.

Things could be worse: That bubble's bursting crushed many nest eggs, but it was largely paid for by individual investors and by companies that threw good money after bad. Not enough was borrowed to leave a hole in the financial system.

The tech bust also left behind useful infrastructure, such as millions of miles of fiber-optic cable. Ditto for the 1970s investment spree in jet aircraft—airlines went bankrupt, but at least we got cheap flights.

That’s the takeaway from a report by Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid. Britain's railway mania also had a “valuable legacy,” a train network, but it was fueled by lots of debt so its collapse caused a recession and banking crisis. Japan’s real estate and stock bubbles and America’s housing boom were the worst of both worlds—not very useful, yet with a nasty economic hangover.

Are the Magnificent Seven actually overspending on AI? Maybe $340 billion in capital investment by hyperscalers just this year is reasonable for something so transformative.

Behavioral economist Owen Lamont, in a report for Acadian Asset Management, writes that the money doesn’t have to be “wasted” for investors to worry about massive capital expenditures. Along with high valuations, they have been a signal for poor stock-market performance in the near future, especially by the companies at the forefront of the new thing. Investors’ “big market delusion” has been that existing leaders plowing funds into a developing technology will dominate it.

Once the money has been spent and the technology’s price comes down, it’s mostly other companies, or society at large, that reap the benefits. Stock prices should reflect that instead of treating all hyperscalers and their suppliers like winners.

A classic error companies themselves make, says Lamont, is “competition neglect.” It seems reasonable to spend $100 billion on AI infrastructure, but maybe not if another massive company’s board makes the same calculation and also spends $100 billion. It's like building a second train line between two cities.

Wouldn’t an executive as smart as Pichai see that and tap on the investment brakes? AI is so new and exciting and the prize so big that his judgment isn’t necessarily any better than that of a 19th-century railroad baron.

With so much stock-market wealth tied to AI, investors are playing with fire."

The move is the latest sign that regulators are shifting toward a softer stance on crypto enforcement under the Trump administration.

The SEC sued Kraken in November 2023, alleging that the company acted simultaneously as a broker, dealer, exchange and clearing agency without registering with the agency.

The lawsuit also alleged that Kraken commingled customers’ crypto assets and fiat currencies with its own, creating what its independent auditor had identified in its audit plan as “a significant risk of loss” to its customers.

The complaint came after Kraken had agreed to stop offering so-called crypto staking services in the U.S. and pay $30 million in penalties to the SEC in February 2023. In January this year, Kraken launched a new staking product for U.S. customers in 37 states and two territories.

Kraken said the SEC intends to dismiss the November lawsuit with prejudice, meaning that the agency can’t refile it with the same claims. The lawsuit will be dismissed without admission of wrongdoing, penalties or changes to Kraken’s business, according to the company.

An SEC spokesperson declined to comment.

In the past week, the SEC has dismissed cases against Coinbase Global and Consensys, while dropping multiple investigations into crypto companies. In many such cases, the agency said it is dropping the lawsuit or investigation while a new SEC crypto task force works on developing “a comprehensive and clear regulatory framework for crypto assets.”"

Volkswagen stock rose as much as 5% after the European Union said it would relax the bloc’s carbon-dioxide emissions rules—removing the immediate threat of fines. Rather than needing to hit aggressive new standards in 2025, automakers will get three years to comply.

While the move to water down the rules was expected after a tumultuous period for the European auto industry, confirmation of the new approach clears one area of uncertainty for investors.

VW is the biggest beneficiary. The European market leader had been expected to pay as much as $1.6 billion in fines if the rules went ahead unchanged. Shares in Mercedes-Benz and France’s Renault also jumped on the announcement, before falling back slightly.

Losers include Tesla and Volvo Cars, which was an early mover in electric vehicles. Both companies were set to receive cash from other automakers in exchange for sharing their emissions for regulatory purposes.

Volvo’s stock fell 1.9% in Sweden. Tesla shares were up roughly 1% in midday U.S. trading.

The rule change is part of a broader European “action plan” set to be announced Wednesday aimed at supporting the region’s auto industry, which is contending with faltering electric-vehicle demand at home and intense competition from EV startups in China.

2025-03-03 15:58:37+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/business/who-is-justin-peterson-119ca3ba,"A Washington, D.C., strategist and lobbyist with deep connections to the Republican Party, Justin Peterson is accustomed to fighting aggressively on behalf of powerful clients such as Exxon Mobil XOM 2.55%increase; green up pointing triangle.

But at a November 2015 breakfast with an Israeli private investigator, Peterson launched a yearslong campaign that federal prosecutors now say crossed a line. 

As he put it in an email following the breakfast, Peterson wanted the investigator to “operationalize the research on the bad guys.” According to prosecutors, in practice that led to something very specific: hacking into the email accounts of Exxon’s enemies.

Peterson hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing or charged in connection with the alleged hacking, but his alleged role in commissioning the operation is described in detail in court documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The documents are part of a continuing U.S. criminal case against the Israeli investigator, Amit Forlit, who is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and computer hacking. Forlit was arrested in London last year and the U.S. is currently seeking his extradition.

Peterson’s firm, called DCI Group, cooperated with prosecutors in 2020 but the firm hasn’t had contact with them in three years, according to a lawyer for DCI. The lawyer said prosecutors told DCI it wasn’t a target.
A grand jury secretly indicted Forlit in November 2022. The charges against him remain under seal, but the indictment and related court filings were introduced as part of the U.K. extradition proceeding.

The documents don’t name Peterson, instead referring to Forlit’s activities commissioned by the managing partner of a D.C. lobbying and public-affairs firm. Peterson, one of two managing partners at DCI, was Forlit’s contact at the firm, according to people familiar with their interactions.

Peterson and Forlit launched what they called “Operation Fox Hunt” in 2015 as activists were increasingly gaining traction with allegations that Exxon had lied about what it knew about climate change.

The court documents allege that Peterson hired Forlit to collect damaging information on environmentalists and other Exxon opponents that could be leaked to the press and used in litigation. Forlit then targeted those individuals through “computer hacking and other cybercrimes.”

“No one at DCI directed or was involved in any hacking alleged to have occurred a decade ago,” a DCI spokesman said. “Meanwhile, radical anti-oil activists and their billionaire donors—many of whom still sleep on beds paid for by their family’s fossil energy legacy trust funds—peddle conspiracy theories.”
Exxon cut ties with DCI in 2020. An Exxon spokesman said it wasn’t involved in or aware of any hacking activities. 

“If there was any hacking involved, we condemn it in the strongest possible terms,” he said.

A U.K. court is expected to rule this month on the U.S. request to extradite Forlit, which he is contesting. His lawyer declined to comment. 
“The wheels of justice are turning awfully slowly in this case but it’s heartening to know they are still rolling toward accountability for those at the heart of these crimes,” said Lee Wasserman, director of the Rockefeller Family Fund, a charity that has opposed Exxon.

Wasserman was among those targeted by hackers, prosecutors say.

Business booming under Trump
The hacking case puts a rare spotlight on Peterson, who prefers to operate the levers of power behind the scenes, according to people who have worked with him.

Peterson and colleagues at DCI have represented some of the country’s most powerful companies and organizations, including Microsoft, Walmart and the National Rifle Association, in addition to Exxon. Peterson also did work on behalf of U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management.

With Trump’s election, business is booming for the Republican operative, say people familiar with the firm’s clients. DCI is staffed with former officials from Trump’s first presidency, and Peterson’s colleagues worked on the president’s transition team.

Trump appointed Peterson to serve three years on the Puerto Rico oversight board tasked with helping manage the U.S. territory’s financial crisis and debt restructuring. He stepped down in 2023.
More recently, Peterson has continued meeting with clients and strategizing with staff, often in person in DCI’s offices on K Street, the capital’s lobbying hub.

A Nebraska native and avowed Cornhuskers fan, Peterson cut his teeth in the power-brokering business during the Bush-Cheney era, working on Republican campaigns as he solidified party alliances. He took those relationships to DCI as the firm itself was expanding further into politics.

The court documents lay bare Peterson’s alleged work with a group of former Israeli intelligence officials, including Forlit, who were known for their ability to leverage hacking networks in India and elsewhere to turn up nonpublic information that could be damaging in litigation.

One alleged beneficiary was the powerful hedge fund Elliott Management, in its yearslong battle against Argentina over defaulted debt. DCI helped by developing a sophisticated media and lobbying blitz portraying the Argentine government as a sovereign deadbeat.

Forlit also worked with DCI during the Argentine debt crisis, and prosecutors are investigating whether Forlit orchestrated the theft of emails from Argentine officials as Elliott’s nearly 15-year battle reached a fever pitch.

The documents say Forlit’s work for DCI related to the Argentine debt crisis began around December 2013, which was during Elliott’s efforts to recover hundreds of millions of dollars from its investment in the country’s bonds. The trade ultimately yielded more than $2 billion.

“No one at Elliott is aware of anyone at the firm ever having authorized, commissioned or paid for any hacking activities,” a spokesman for Elliott said.

‘BOOM’
The Exxon work began later, starting around October 2015. 

Soon after their breakfast, Peterson emailed Forlit about a California nonprofit founded by billionaire Tom Steyer. The former hedge-fund manager had been throwing millions of dollars into publicizing climate-change concerns and backing political candidates friendly to the cause.

“Got it / Please see silent,” Forlit responded, referring his client to encrypted messaging systems, according to the documents.

The documents allege that almost instantaneously, Peterson sent Forlit a memo. “This is what I gave the client yesterday,” it read, adding, “This is how I would operationalize the research on the bad guys.” The memo proposed finding ways to highlight what Peterson referred to as the “true agenda of the individuals” behind climate-change advocacy.
Over a period of almost five years, between December 2013 and mid-2018, DCI ultimately paid Forlit’s firms about $16 million for services that involved hackers based in India, the court documents say.

Forlit didn’t hide his methods, prosecutors say. In 2018, he sent DCI a “Capabilities Statement” that included “offensive cyber attacks through malware and interception,” according to the documents.

As Fox Hunt kicked off, Forlit and his hired crew engaged in a range of tactics, including intelligence-gathering from public sources and illegal breaches of private email accounts, according to U.S. prosecutors. Those breaches yielded private communications from the targets, some of which Peterson subsequently shared with Exxon before DCI leaked them to the press.

The leaks fed stories that Exxon later referenced in court proceedings as evidence that climate activists were ginning up politically motivated investigations with states’ attorneys general.

Prosecutors said they identified at least 128 individual targets of the hackers related to the climate-change project, including the Rockefeller Family Fund. The fund was created by the descendants of John D. Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil, a monopoly that was broken up and eventually led to the creation of Exxon. The Rockefeller heirs in recent years have become outspoken critics of Exxon and its approach to climate change. 

Peterson’s work with Forlit ran deep and the pair were in frequent contact, according to the documents. 

In March 2016, Peterson shared with Exxon a private strategy memo from a plaintiff’s lawyer suing Exxon and other oil companies, Matt Pawa. The document was stolen, according to prosecutors. DCI subsequently organized a campaign against Pawa and pitched reporters on writing a story about the memo.

On the day a news article was published leaking the memo, Peterson allegedly emailed a link to executives at Exxon. He also sent a celebratory email to colleagues at DCI about the article with the subject line: “BOOM.”"
2025-03-03 15:58:37+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/emulsifiers-make-food-more-appealing-do-they-also-make-you-sick-be0850ae,"They keep salad dressing from separating, ice cream from dripping and muffins from hardening. Emulsifiers, used to improve the texture of food, are in all sorts of products. But there is growing concern about the potential health risks from eating them. 

Recent studies have found that consuming common emulsifiers is linked to a higher risk of heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Other research seems to show why: The substances change the gut microbiome in a way that can cause inflammation. 

Emulsifiers may partly explain why diets high in ultra-processed foods are associated with health problems. Ultra-processed foods, which include everything from energy bars and chips to deli meat and many soups, are facing increased scrutiny by the Trump administration. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has said that the Food and Drug Administration will investigate food additives. Kennedy has often blamed the substances for chronic diseases in the U.S.  

The new research on emulsifiers is upending what scientists thought they knew about them. Many common emulsifiers were considered safe because they aren’t readily absorbed by the body. But now researchers understand that this very quality enables emulsifiers to disrupt the microbiome. 

Emulsifiers are harder to avoid than some other food additives, like artificial sweeteners and colors, because they are difficult to taste and see and their use is so widespread. The ingredients are cheap and increase stability and shelf life. 

“They make the food taste exactly the same every time,” said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University. 

Emulsifiers are commonly found in junk food, but they are also used in foods that have a healthy image—like some yogurts, whole grain crackers and breakfast cereals, said Mathilde Touvier, research director at the National Institute of Health and Medical Research in France. In one study by Touvier and colleagues, researchers analyzed the ingredients in 126,000 packaged food and drink products available in France: Emulsifiers were in about 54% of them.

The food industry defends their use. “Emulsifiers and thickening agents play an important role in improving food texture and consistency, and have been studied by the FDA through a rigorous scientific and risk-based process,” said Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy at the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group that includes many food makers.

There are dozens of different emulsifiers and thickeners. Some, like carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate 80, are synthetic. Others, like soy lecithin and guar gum, are derived from natural sources. 
People who have higher intakes of several common emulsifiers are more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer, according to three recent studies by Touvier and colleagues. The studies, which followed about 92,000 to 104,000 people over approximately seven years, controlled for a variety of factors, including age, body-mass index and family medical history. 

The research, because it is what’s known as observational, doesn’t prove that emulsifiers are causing health problems. And some of the increased risks are small. But emerging science is finding that some emulsifiers alter the gut microbiome in a way that can cause inflammation. Inflammation has been implicated in a host of diseases. 

In a small study with 16 people, the microbiomes of subjects who ate the emulsifier carboxymethylcellulose for 11 days were altered: They had fewer types of bacteria, more bacteria associated with poor health and less “good” bacteria than those who didn’t get the substance. (The diets of the two groups were identical, except for the emulsifier.) 

Also, two participants in the emulsifier group had bacteria that had invaded the inner mucus layer in the gut. This encroachment is thought to lead to inflammation not just in the digestive system but throughout the body, said Andrew Gewirtz, a professor at Georgia State University and an author of the study, which was published in 2022 in the journal Gastroenterology. 

The study in people builds on a larger body of research in animals and in the lab. Some recent research has found that people vary in their body’s response to emulsifiers. Scientists in the U.K. and France are investigating a low-emulsifier diet as a potential treatment for Crohn’s disease. You can avoid emulsifiers altogether by not eating ultra-processed foods. But that isn’t realistic for a lot of us. 

The most concerning emulsifiers are the synthetic ones like carboxymethylcellulose, which is widely used in packaged baked goods, and polysorbate 80, which is often used in ice cream and other dairy products, says Gewirtz. He suggests avoiding the gums, like guar gum and xanthan gum, too. These substances generally aren’t digested. They pass through the large intestine, where they disrupt the microbiome, says Gewirtz. Watch out for carrageenans, too, says Benoit Chassaing, head of the Microbiome-Host Interactions Group at Institut Pasteur in France. These are particularly common in low-fat yogurt and other low-fat dairy products. In his research, carrageenans reduce the amount of beneficial bacteria and promote the growth of bacteria associated with poor health.

The common emulsifier soy lecithin is likely less harmful, Gewirtz says, because it is a natural product that is more readily absorbed. 

Touvier recommends the website and app Open Food Facts, a crowdsourced food database, that flags emulsifiers and other food additives.

The actual food you’re eating is still the most important factor in rating its healthiness, Mozaffarian notes. “If you’re consuming yogurt or a fruit dish or bean dish and it has one of these stabilizers in it, it’s still better for you than consuming bacon or, you know, candy,” he says."

2025-03-03 18:30:00+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/articles/advance-auto-parts-revamps-supply-chain-in-effort-to-reverse-sales-slump-02e61f0f,"Advance Auto Parts is overhauling its supply chain as it seeks to turn around years of shrinking market share and anemic sales growth.

The Raleigh, N.C., company is consolidating distribution centers, closing hundreds of its roughly 4,800 stores and opening larger regional locations as it aims to better compete with rivals such as AutoZone and O’Reilly Automotive. The strategy is meant to simplify the supply chain of the fourth-largest U.S. car-parts retailer as it looks to get the products customers want into their hands more quickly.

“Consolidating the supply chain to create the right part in the right place is an absolute linchpin of what we’re doing,” Chief Executive Shane O’Kelly said in an interview.

Advance, which serves both do-it-yourself customers and professional mechanics, has increased sales at a much slower pace than its rivals over the past decade. The company last week reported about $2 billion in fourth-quarter sales, down slightly from a year earlier, while its rivals’ sales grew in their latest quarters. 

The company’s shares were trading at $36.49 early Monday, down 85% from an all-time high in November 2021. Shares of AutoZone over the same time have climbed about 82% while O’Reilly’s have more than doubled. 

Advance’s underperformance in recent years drew the attention of activist hedge fund Third Point, which last year struck a deal with the company to add three directors to its board. Under the new board’s leadership, Advance sold its wholesale auto-parts distribution business, Worldpac, to Carlyle Group for $1.5 billion in an effort to slim down and improve profitability. Third Point sold its stake in Advance late last year.

The company’s leadership also has changed. Longtime CEO Tom Greco retired at the end of 2023 and was succeeded by O’Kelly, a former Home Depot executive who has since undertaken a strategic review of the business.
One of the challenges Advance has faced is that auto-parts retailers have to both carry a wide variety of products and rapidly meet the needs of customers, who are typically looking to fix a problem with their vehicle as quickly as possible. That means figuring out how to position a large number of products within a short distance of customers.

Advance is restructuring its supply chain to flow goods from distribution centers to regional market hubs and on to traditional stores. The hubs carry more products than its typical stores, allowing Advance to quickly send an item out from a hub to a nearby store when needed without having to wait for a shipment from a distribution center.

O’Kelly said Advance studied some of its competitors and found they were able to get a wider selection of parts to customers in a shorter time frame. “This market-hub node helps solve for that,” he said. “What it introduces is about 85,000 parts that are available to a store, and hence a customer, inside of the same day.”

Advance has 19 market hubs across the U.S. today, with plans to add an additional 10 this year. It aims to have 60 such facilities by mid-2027.

The company also has been consolidating its warehouses and closing stores. O’Kelly said when he took over as CEO in September 2023, he found redundancies lingering in the company’s supply-chain network from its $2 billion acquisition of General Parts International a decade earlier. 

Advance since then has closed 10 of 38 U.S. distribution centers and said it would shut an additional 12 this year. It plans to have 12 warehouses nationwide by the end of 2026. Advance is also in the process of closing about 500 corporate stores and 200 independently owned locations by the end of March.

The company is resetting its assortment-planning process to move away from restocking stores based on what has sold in the past. Instead, it is carrying more items that may be in demand in a particular region. For example, if there are a large number of trucks in a given area, those stores would carry more truck-specific parts. "
2025-03-03 20:00:02+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/u-s-hitting-brakes-on-flow-of-arms-to-ukraine-980a71d1,"The U.S. will pause all military aid to Kyiv until President Trump determines that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is making a good-faith effort toward peace negotiations with Russia, according to a White House official.

“The president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,” a White House official said in a statement.

The White House didn’t announce under what conditions the U.S. would resume military aid, which drew from U.S. stockpiles, or whether it would be at the same pace. While there isn’t a clear understanding of what Washington wants from Kyiv, the move was the most demonstrative shift yet from Ukraine’s once top ally. 

A senior administration official said all of Trump’s top national security advisers agreed with the decision to pause the aid after several meetings on the issue. Trump, enraged by Zelensky’s comments that he thought the end of the war was far away, felt the need to show he was serious about getting Ukraine to the peace table.

“The Ukrainians didn’t think we were serious,” the administration official said. “We had to make a demonstration.”

The official said Trump would decide what constitutes Ukraine showing that it is serious about peace talks, adding that it is unclear whether Zelensky signing a rare-minerals deal sought by the Trump administration would be enough to restart arms deliveries.The U.S. decision comes days after a contentious meeting between Trump and Zelensky at the White House. The tense exchange Friday raised fears across Europe that the U.S. could be moving away from the wider Western alliance. 

The U.S. has provided more than $120 billion in aid since Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago, including $67.3 billion in military aid. But it also provided intelligence and training and rallied the international community to support Ukraine. European nations contributed an additional $138 billion in military and humanitarian aid, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a research group in Germany. 

The White House announcement underscored the growing divisions over foreign policy in Trump’s Republican Party, as some lawmakers cheered the move and others warned against it.

“Stopping support for Ukraine would jeopardize the stability of Europe and the free world,” Rep. Mike Lawler (R., N.Y.) said on X. “There are strong opinions on both sides of this issue, and I respect that. However, we must be pragmatic about the bigger picture and protect America’s interests abroad,” he added.

“Too bad Iran, North Korea and China are not pausing their military aid and economic support,” Rep. Don Bacon (R., Neb.) said about Russia’s supporters. “There is an invader and a victim, there is a democracy and a dictatorship, there is a country who wants to be part of the West and one who hates the West. We should be unambiguously for the good side,” he said.

Rep. Mary Miller (R., Ill.) backs Trump’s decision. “If Zelensky wants to continue fighting an endless war, let him do it himself,” she said on X. “The U.S. will no longer participate in this conflict that has led to the death of thousands. It’s time for peace!”

The decision also drew the ire of Ukraine’s supporters who warned pausing aid would prolong the war, not speed up the peace process. 

“Stopping military aid to Ukraine is incredibly damaging to the United States and a sad day for American interests because it rewards our adversaries,” said Mykola Murskyj, director of advocacy at Razom for Ukraine. “I can hear the Champagne popping in Moscow, Beijing and Tehran.” 

The Trump administration had previously stopped financing new weapons sales to Ukraine, another move that threatened Kyiv’s ability to fight at a critical time in its battle against Russian forces, current and former U.S. officials said.

Trump on Monday said Zelensky should be “more appreciative because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin.” A proposed mineral-rights deal between the U.S. and Ukraine would provide Kyiv with added security—even without explicit U.S. defense guarantees sought by Zelensky—because the U.S. would have a “presence there,” Trump said.

He lashed out at Zelensky for saying the war with Russia was likely to continue for some time. “This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!” Trump wrote on his social-media platform Truth Social, using the different spelling of the Ukrainian leader’s name. 

The U.S. weapons cutoff would leave Ukraine less able to withstand Russian attacks, analysts said.“Ukraine wouldn’t surrender tomorrow or next week, but they would lose military capability gradually and at some point they would face defeat,” said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and former U.S. official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.

Ukraine had been able to get weapons from the U.S. through several means, including Foreign Military Financing, which provides loans and grants for nations to buy weapons from U.S. defense companies, and the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which allows the Pentagon to buy weapons for Kyiv but is currently out of funds. However, presidential drawdown authority, which the U.S. paused Monday, allowed the Defense Department to pull directly from its own stockpiles and had been the most significant tool for arming Ukraine.  

The shutdown of financing new weapons sales began before Friday’s acrimonious meeting, during which Ukraine and the U.S. were supposed to sign a framework agreement for a mineral-rights deal but instead canceled the ceremony and a scheduled press conference. The Monday administration meetings, which led to the suspension of ongoing weapons shipments to Ukraine, emerged after the Friday blowup at the White House. 

Without new U.S. military aid, Ukraine likely has enough weapons to keep fighting Russia at its current pace until the middle of this year, current and former Western officials say. That is the result in part of a surge of new weapons approved by the Biden administration in its final days. Over the weekend, European leaders held a summit in London and agreed to form a coalition to forge a Ukraine peace plan to present to Trump that would include ground troops and military assets. 

European allies and Ukraine’s own growing defense industry can make up for some of the potential shortfall, but an end to U.S. aid would cut Ukraine’s access to advanced weapons systems that are important to its strategy of countering Russia’s full-scale assault on its territory.

If the U.S. shutdown persists, Ukraine would lose its supply of some sophisticated weapons, including advanced air-defense systems, surface-to-surface ballistic missiles, navigation systems and long-range rocket artillery. The U.S. is the sole producer of some systems, including Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or Himars, which give the Ukrainians the ability to strike far behind Russian lines.

Once those U.S. supplies run out, Ukraine’s ability to conduct longer-range strikes, and to protect its own rear positions, would suffer, officials and analysts say.

“Europe can step in to meet a fair amount of Ukraine’s need for artillery ammunition when combined with munitions already shipped by the U.S. early this year,” said Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who frequently visits Ukrainian front-line units. “The challenges will be more visible as we get into summer.”

Over time, Ukraine could find it harder to make longer-term plans for its military arsenal or to buy parts for its existing systems. Ukraine currently builds or finances about 55% of its military hardware. The U.S. supplies around 20%, while Europe supplies 25%.

Up until Monday’s announcement, the Trump administration had sent some of the weapons promised by the Biden administration, the Pentagon said, including “hundreds of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) and antitank weapons and thousands of artillery rounds that Ukraine is employing on the battlefield when they are available from our stocks.”

The last major new arms package for Ukraine was on Dec. 30, during the Biden administration, and included some advanced weapons like munitions for air-defense systems, Stinger missiles and other weapons. The package was worth $1.22 billion. No new weapons transfers have been announced since.

There are over $3 billion in funds to draw from existing stockpiles that have been authorized by Congress but not allocated by the administration, the congressional aide said."

The broad market’s tariff-induced selloff on Monday hit the AI titan particularly hard. Nvidia’s share price slid nearly 9% to log the worst performance of the U.S. megacap tech stocks for the day. Investors are worried about tariffs and the potential for further export restrictions from the Trump administration that could curb much of the company’s business in China. In a note to clients Monday, Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho cited the possibility of “a complete ban of all AI chips to China,” which he said could cost Nvidia between $4 billion and $6 billion in revenue for the company’s current fiscal year.

Monday's fall wasn't even the biggest one-day drop the stock has seen since the first of the year, as Nvidia has been hit by fears about the sustainability of AI spending and worries about competition--sometimes from its own customers making their own AI chips. The declines have cost Nvidia about 19% of its market value over the past three months. Among megacap techs, only Tesla has fared worse in that time, as the EV maker has shown a significant drop in sales amid concerns about its CEO's effort to slash the size of the federal workforce.

But Tesla’s shares are still trading at a pristine valuation of more than 90 times projected earnings for the current year. Nvidia’s multiple has now fallen below 25 times – making it the cheapest megacap tech stock save for Google-parent Alphabet, which now trades around 18 times forward earnings.

Nvidia’s valuation is now below even the discount it fetched in the wake of the market’s panic in January over the revelations of DeepSeek. The Chinese AI startup made fresh claims over the weekend about the cost efficiency of its AI models. In a report Monday, UBS Chief Investment Officer Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi said DeepSeek showed “an impressive level of optimizations,” but added that lower costs will lead to higher AI adoption.

Susan Morris, Albertsons’ operating chief, will succeed Sankaran, effective May 1, and join its board of directors. The Boise, Idaho-based retailer said on Monday that Sankaran’s departure is part of a planned retirement.

The disclosure of Sankaran’s impending departure comes the same day Kroger said CEO Rodney McMullen would resign after an investigation into his personal conduct. Sankaran has headed Albertsons since April 2019 and helped lead efforts to combine the grocery chain with Kroger in a deal that was eventually struck down by the Federal Trade Commission. Sankaran was previously an executive with PepsiCo.

His successor, Morris, has been operating chief of Albertsons since January 2018. She is an industry veteran with nearly four decades of experience in the retail grocery sector.

“The board is confident that Susan is the ideal person to lead the company into its next chapter of growth,” Chair Jim Donald said, adding that the election of Morris as CEO follows a thoughtful succession planning process that evaluated both internal and external candidates.

Morris said her appointment comes at a time of profound change for the grocery industry.

Last year, as court proceedings around the merger ensued, Sankaran warned regulators that Albertsons would have to consider closing stores or laying off workers if a judge rejected Kroger’s planned $20 billion takeover, as Walmart and Amazon continued to take market share from the grocery chain.

Albertsons also on Monday backed its outlook for the year. The company is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings on April 28, according to FactSet."

Can stepping on a butterfly change the course of history, as imagined in Ray Bradbury’s “A Sound of Thunder”? Imponderables like this have long fascinated philosophers and science-fiction writers. But if a case currently before the Supreme Court goes the wrong way, such flights of fancy will be injected into our law, vastly expanding the scope of potential liability for every individual and business in the country.

Until recently, no one expected butterfly-effect theories to invade our legal system. The age-old doctrine of “proximate cause” ensured that parties can be held liable only for harms that are the direct and immediate consequence of their own actions. They can’t be held responsible for harms connected with their own actions in only a highly attenuated way. And rightly so—the alternative would be a nightmare world in which everyone is at risk of being held liable for consequences occurring downstream of their actions, no matter how remote. As Justice Antonin Scalia memorably put it, “ ‘for want of a nail, a kingdom was lost’ is a commentary on fate, not the statement of a major cause of action against a blacksmith.”

But a group of ideologically driven plaintiff lawyers, along with the Mexican government—desperate to divert attention from its failure to challenge the drug cartels—would like to change that. Mexico has sued Smith & Wesson and several other American gun manufacturers, seeking injunctive relief and $10 billion in damages. Mexico’s theory is that because some criminals illegally procure and smuggle a tiny percentage of American-made guns into Mexico, and Mexican cartels ultimately use these guns in crime, the American gun industry is liable for the costs sustained by the Mexican government for all gun violence within its borders. If the plaintiffs win the injunction they seek, the defendants would no longer be able to sell popular guns to law-abiding U.S. citizens.

A district judge dismissed Mexico’s lawsuit, but the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated it, holding that Mexico plausibly alleged that the defendants were “aiding and abetting” unlawful gun sales by independent, downstream dealers and were the “proximate cause” of the harms suffered by the Mexican government from drug cartel violence. The Supreme Court hears oral arguments on Tuesday in Smith & Wesson v. Mexico.

Mexico’s attenuated theory of liability is absurd. Congress categorically rejected it decades ago. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, activists in deep-blue state and local governments invented novel tort theories to hold America’s legal and heavily regulated gun industry responsible for urban crime. These litigants invoked a wide array of theories: claims of negligent marketing, negligent distribution, deceptive trade practices, public nuisance and more. While state courts rejected many of these expansive theories, advocates candidly acknowledged that winning wasn’t the only point. It was a “death by a thousand cuts” strategy, as future New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. Had these suits been permitted to persist and proliferate, “the legal fees alone” would be “enough to bankrupt the industry,” in the words of lawyer John Coale.

Congress recognized these lawsuits for what they were and responded by passing the bipartisan Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA, in 2005. This law prohibits lawsuits against federally licensed members of the gun industry arising out of the criminal or unlawful misuse of guns by third parties. The PLCAA contains a narrow exception for lawsuits involving well-established violations of laws regulating the sale of guns, such as knowingly selling one to a straw purchaser. This exception is tightly drawn, however, and includes a requirement that the lawsuit must satisfy traditional notions of proximate cause, not seek to hold a gun manufacturer responsible for harms caused by criminals it can’t control.

The PLCAA settled the law until this lawsuit was brought in 2021. By that time, it had become clear that the Mexican government’s policy of “hugging” the cartels instead of resisting them was a failure. Violence continued and the cartels tightened their grip on Mexican society. What better way to deflect blame than to claim that the American gun industry was responsible for the cartels’ success?

One of the architects of the pre-PLCAA suits persuaded the Mexican government to test the limits of the law again, this time through a lawsuit claiming that American gun manufacturers are aiding and abetting gun crime in Mexico. The Mexican government argues that proximate cause should be interpreted so broadly as to be satisfied any time it is foreseeable to a company that lawfully manufactures and sells guns that some of them might one day find their way into the hands of people who will misuse them—which it always is.

That argument not only is wrong, but also poses a grave threat to any manufacturer of anything that could be misused. Turning proximate cause into a simple question of foreseeability would hang a Sword of Damocles—unknown and limitless liability—over the heads of all American businesses. It is foreseeable that the internet will be used by criminals to conduct their criminal activity, but that doesn’t make internet access providers liable for the actions of criminals. Industries that supply the necessities of everyday life and sustain the economy could fall prey to lawsuits seeking to blame them for all manner of societal woes—hurting all American consumers in the process.

That it is a foreign sovereign urging these arguments here makes this case even more extraordinary. Mexico has no license to reach beyond its borders and enlist American courts in an effort to anoint itself a de facto policymaker in the U.S.—let alone to elevate its own policy preferences over fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. The high court should head this threat off at the pass by circumscribing proximate cause to its traditional limits."

European defense stocks led broad gains across stock markets and the euro recovered from Friday’s two-week low against the dollar as investors digested European leaders’ push for a ‘coalition of the willing’ on Ukraine.

Among the stocks, BAE rose 16%, Thales 14%, and Rheinmetall and Leonardo both gained 16%.

Asian shares were mixed, with Hong Kong giving up early gains ahead of the National People’s Congress meeting starting this week. The NPC, the country’s most influential decision-making body, meets amid mounting tensions between the U.S. and China due to Trump’s additional 10% tariff on Beijing, effective Tuesday.

2025-03-03T03:21:09Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/621990/autonomous-speed-record-indy-challenge-maserati,"Look out: there’s a new fastest robot in the world.
A Maserati MC20 Coupe with no one in the driver’s seat set a new land speed record for autonomous vehicles, reaching 197.7mph (318km/h) during an automotive event at the Kennedy Space Center last week.
The Maserati was running self-driving software developed by Politecnico di Milano, Italy’s largest scientific and technological university. The team also worked with the Indy Autonomous Challenge, which most recently ran at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway during CES 2025.
197.7 > 192.2
In the shadow of NASA’s iconic Space Shuttles, the race car flew down the 2.8-mile runway at record-breaking speeds, surpassing the 192.2mph record that was also held by Indy Autonomous Challenge and PoliMOVE, set by an IAC AV-21 race car in April 2022.
The achievement is noteworthy, and not just because an autonomous race car went faster than any other self-driving vehicle before it. It’s partly about stress-testing the reliability of the algorithms that undergird the autonomous driving system, determining how they manage extreme speeds. By pushing the boundaries, the team overseeing the record-breaking run hopes to improve safety by applying their learnings to autonomous road vehicles operating on local roads.

“These world speed records are much more than just a showcase of future technology,” Paul Mitchell, CEO of Indy Autonomous Challenge and Aidoptation BV, said in a statement. “We are pushing AI-driver software and robotics hardware to the absolute edge. Doing so with a streetcar is helping transition the learnings of autonomous racing to enable safe, secure, sustainable, high-speed autonomous mobility on highways.”

The Maserati MC20 is a stylish — and expensive — choice for the autonomous run. Retailing for at least $239,000, the race car sports a mid-mounted, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that Maserati calls the Nettuno. The engine makes serious power: 621 horsepower and 538 pound-feet of torque, which is sent through an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission to the rear wheels.

2025-03-03T04:28:38Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-03/reliance-unit-risks-india-fine-in-rebuke-for-ambani-s-empire,"A unit of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd. risks being penalized after failing to set up a battery cell plant that formed part of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s push to cut import dependence, according to people familiar with the matter.

Reliance New Energy Ltd., among companies that won a bid for battery cell manufacturing in 2022 under an Indian government plan to reward local production, is liable to pay fines of as much as 1.25 billion rupees ($14.3 million) for missing a deadline, said the people who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private.

Rajesh Exports Ltd., which also applied under this government initiative to make battery cells, is also on the hook for stalling the advanced-chemistry cell program and could be levied similar sized penalties, they said.

The small monetary fines are a mere rap on the knuckle, especially for Asia’s richest person and his Reliance conglomerate. But the failure to reach state-directed manufacturing goals reflects the technological challenges and shifting market dynamics that can stymie Modi’s ‘Make in India’ vision to rival China as the world’s factory.

Modi has sought to boost manufacturing to 25% of gross domestic product but the share has slipped to 13% in 2023 from 15% in 2014.

Representatives for Reliance Industries, Rajesh Exports and India’s Heavy Industries Ministry, which overseas this initiative, didn’t respond to emails seeking comments.

Reliance shares slipped to a 15-month low on Monday during Mumbai trading before paring some of the losses. The stock closed 2.4% lower on the day.

Patchy Success
While subsidies to manufacturers under the so-called Production-Linked Incentives, or PLI, have worked well to boost local assembly of smartphones, the success hasn’t been uniform across sectors.

Reliance New Energy, Rajesh Exports and the unit of Ola Electric Mobility Ltd. had won bids in 2022 to build the battery cell plants — part of the country’s push to reduce dependence on imports for electric vehicles — under the PLI program.

Manufacturers were eligible for 181 billion rupees worth of subsidies on meeting milestones for the project that sought to create a cumulative 30 gigawatt-hour capacity of advanced chemistry cell battery storage.

The firms were required to achieve a minimum ‘committed capacity,’ along with local value addition of 25% within two years of the agreement, and 50% within five years, the people said.

The third player in the mix, however, billionaire Bhavish Aggarwal’s Ola Cell Technologies Pvt. has made progress on its commitments under this PLI program.

The Ola unit started trial production in March last year and plans to start commercial production of lithium-ion cells in the April to June quarter, a spokesperson for Ola Electric said in an emailed response. “We are well on track to meet the set timelines,” he said.

‘Risky to Invest’
The Reliance unit, meanwhile, has turned its focus to green hydrogen, a fuel seen as key to a carbon-free future, as part of a shift in the company’s priorities, the people said. The companies are also yet to firm up the technology needed to manufacture lithium-ion cells locally.


“It was quite risky to invest in cell manufacturing last year - too much uncertainty with a lot of global overcapacity and uncertain trade environment,” Jiayan Shi, a BloombergNEF analyst, said.

Also, the capital investment needed for building lithium-ion battery plants is very high, ranging from $60 to $80 million per gigawatt-hour, she added.



Moreover, global lithium-ion phosphate, or LFP, battery prices have been on the decline. This has made imports of cells cheaper than ever, creating uncertainty around domestic demand and slowing the pace of investments in India.

Although Reliance New Energy did acquire sodium-ion cell maker Faradion in 2021 and Netherlands-based Lithium Werks, including its manufacturing facilities in China, in 2022, they represented small investments."
2025-03-03T06:05:51Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-03/ola-electric-said-to-cut-over-a-thousand-jobs-to-stem-losses,"Ola Electric Mobility Ltd. is laying off over a thousand employees and contract workers, people familiar with the matter said, as one of India’s top scooter-makers races to pare ballooning losses.

The cuts at the SoftBank Group Corp.-backed firm, span multiple departments, including procurement, fulfillment, customer relations and charging infrastructure, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private.
It’s the second round of layoffs in under five months as the Bhavish Aggarwal-led company, which just listed last August, battles crises on several fronts. It posted a 50% surge in losses for the December quarter and has been censured by India’s market regulator and consumer protection authority in recent months.
Around 500 employees were laid off last November, according to local reports. The current round of layoffs amount to over a quarter of Ola’s 4,000 employee size as of end-March 2024, but includes contract workers that aren’t counted in the company’s public disclosures.

Automation
As part of the restructuring, Ola is automating parts of its customer relations operations, the people said. The layoff plans may change over time as per business needs, they added.

“We have restructured and automated our front-end operations delivering improved margins, reduced cost, and enhanced customer experience while eliminating redundant roles for better productivity”, an Ola spokesperson said in an emailed response to Bloomberg, without addressing the number of workers cut.

Front-end sales, service and warehouse staff at Ola’s showrooms and service centers are also being let go as the Bengaluru-based firm revamps its logistics and delivery strategy to reduce costs, the people said.

Ola Electric’s shares fell as much as 5.5% during trading in Mumbai on Monday, touching a record low, before paring some of the losses. The stock closed 3% lower.

Backlash
Shares of Ola Electric have plunged over 60% from its peak since a blockbuster IPO debut in August. In recent years, the company has been the target of buyer complaints, social media backlash and market share loss as rivals toppled it from its perch as the sector leader.

On Friday, Ola Electric told Indian exchanges that it sold more than 25,000 units in February with a 28% market share — far lower than the 50,000-unit monthly target Aggarwal said in a Feb. 7 earnings call was the threshold for Ebitda breakeven.

Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.

Days earlier, the company had informed investors that its vehicle registrations will be impacted in February as it renegotiates terms with two of its vendors to reduce costs and improve efficiencies."
2025-03-03T13:00:19Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/622817/firefly-aerospace-blue-ghost-nasa-moon-landing,"The Blue Ghost spacecraft has landed on the Moon, making history as the first private lander to “successfully” achieve this feat, according to its creator, Firefly Aerospace. The Texas-based commercial aerospace firm announced on Sunday that its lander had “softly touched down on the Moon’s surface in an upright, stable configuration.”

This is technically the second private spacecraft to land on the lunar surface. Intuitive Machines’ Odysseus lander, which touched down last February, was the first US spacecraft to land on the Moon since the 1972 Apollo 17 mission, but its mission was cut short after it toppled over.

Having nailed its own landing, Blue Ghost will now spend a full lunar day (about two weeks) performing research operations, including “lunar subsurface drilling, sample collection, X-ray imaging, and dust mitigation experiments.” These experiments aim to provide environmental data and test technologies that will help NASA again land crewed astronaut missions on the Moon. Blue Ghost is also expected to capture high-definition images of a total eclipse on March 14th, which will see Earth blocking the sun when viewed from the Moon.


“With the hardest part behind us, Firefly looks forward to completing more than 14 days of surface operations, again raising the bar for commercial cislunar capabilities,” said Firefly Aerospace chief technology officer Shea Ferring. “We want to thank NASA for entrusting in the Firefly team, and we look forward to delivering even more science data that supports future human missions to the Moon and Mars.”

Blue Ghost was launched from Cape Canaveral aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on January 15th, alongside Resilience — another private lunar lander built by Japan’s iSpace aerospace firm. Resilience is taking a longer, more energy-efficient route to reach the Moon that’s aided by gravity propulsion and isn’t expected to arrive until early May.

Blue Ghost arrived at its lunar destination after traveling 2.8 million miles over 45 days while downlinking more than 27GB of data. It then spent two weeks orbiting the Moon prior to landing on March 2nd, touching down just 100 meters away from its target location within the 300-mile-wide Mare Crisium.

“This incredible achievement demonstrates how NASA and American companies are leading the way in space exploration for the benefit of all,” acting NASA administrator Janet Petro said. “We have already learned many lessons – and the technological and science demonstrations onboard Firefly’s Blue Ghost Mission 1 will improve our ability to not only discover more science, but to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments for future human exploration – both in the short term and long term.”"
2025-03-03T16:00:50Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/622953/google-chrome-extensions-ublock-origin-disabled-manifest-v3,"Google is disabling the original uBlock Origin ad blocker for more Chrome browser users, alongside other extensions that are no longer supported as the browser migrates to its new extension specification, Manifest V3. According to Google, the new standard aims to improve privacy and security, but also removes a feature that some ad blocking extensions relied on to work — a compromise that Mozilla is unwilling to make for its own Firefox browser.
Users online are reporting on Reddit and X that Chrome is removing outdated extensions. In Chrome, a notification window will appear underneath the extensions tab on the browser taskbar with a message encouraging users to remove the impacted add-on, saying it has been turned off and is “no longer supported.” Two buttons are available that allow users to either quickly delete or manage their extensions.


Google’s uBlock Origin phaseout on Chromium-based browsers began in October, but started to have a wider impact in recent weeks. Bleeping Computer has also reported that extensions on staffers devices are being turned off, and Verge staffers have seen similar updates on our own machines.
These changes come as Google migrates Chrome away from the now defunct Manifest V2 specification. Support is being killed not just for uBlock Origin, but for any extension that hasn’t (or is unable to) update to Manifest V3. uBlock Origin users can switch to uBlock Origin Lite, which has more limited filtering capabilities than its predecessor due to Manifest V3’s ad blocking restrictions.
Chrome won’t be the only service affected by the Manifest V3 rollout — other Chromium-based web browsers like Microsoft Edge are also losing V2 support and Brave says it can only offer “limited” support once all Manifest V2 items are removed from the Chrome Web Store. Mozilla says that Firefox will continue offering both extension specifications, however, potentially giving uBlock Origin users a new browser to relocate to.

2025-03-03T16:23:26Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/622963/byd-dji-vehicle-mounted-drone-launcher,"EV maker BYD unveiled “Lingyuan,” a vehicle-mounted drone launching system developed in collaboration with DJI that is available for all of the company’s vehicles, reports Chinese state media outlet Xinhua. The system is only available in China, like BYD’s vehicles, and costs 16,000 yuan (or about $2,197).

BYD’s video below, reposted by YouTube channel ShanghaiEye, has some real science fiction vibes: the driver taps a button on their vehicle’s touch screen, and doors slide open on the top of the car, revealing a rising landing platform with a drone on it. The drone is shown lifting off while the EV is in motion in some shots, then following the car down the road.



A CnEVPost story says the drones can take off and land “at speeds up to 25 km/h” and that they can return automatically as long as they’re within two kilometers of the vehicle. The story also says the drone can follow at up to 54 kilometers per hour. The hangar charges the drone when it’s docked.

The Lingyuan purchase price includes a DJI drone — reports don’t seem to say which, but the video shows a DJI Air 3S — as well as the roof-mounted drone hangar, and apps that work with the system, according to South China Morning Post. The apps include one for video editing (possibly one of DJI’s existing apps) as well as one for “AI recognition,” whose function isn’t specified by SCMP. Google-translated text from BYD’s demo video revealing the system mentions “AI Posture recognition, Lingyuan takes photos around the car.” It’s not clear whether BYD owners can install the system on a vehicle themselves.

BYD and DJI collaborated in “developing a fully integrated system from the ground up,” BYD chairman Wang Chuanfu said at a launch event in Chinese tech hub Shenzhen on Sunday, writes SCMP. The automaker also reportedly introduced a version of its Bao 8 SUV that comes “pre-equipped with the Lingyuan system.”

It’s not BYD’s first venture into drone launchers. Its luxury brand, Yangwang, launched an off-road variant of its U8 SUV with one attached to its roof rails, but that looks much larger than the Lingyuan featured in BYD’s video.

Lingyuan sounds a lot like DJI’s Dock 3 drone-in-a-box solution meant for use in tasks like power line inspections or emergency response. The Dock 3 was the first verson of the DJI Dock to let you launch the drones from a moving vehicle, but it costs quite a bit more than the Lingyuan system: it starts at $21,059, a price that doesn’t include installation, for a bundle with a DJI Matrice 4D drone."

BYD plans to sell 129.80 million shares priced at 335.20 Hong Kong dollars each, equivalent to US$43.10, it said in a stock exchange filing Tuesday. The shares are priced at an 11.8% discount to the average closing price of HK$380.10, for the last 10 consecutive trading days up to and including March 3, it said.

The company expects to raise about HK$43.51 billion in gross proceeds, equivalent to US$5.59 billion, it said.

BYD intends to use part of the proceeds for research and development and accelerate its overseas expansion. It will also continue to invest in R&D related to the field of intelligence driving, it said.

BYD’s rationale for the share placement is reasonable, said Eunice Lee, a senior analyst at Bernstein in a note. “We have long been bullish on the company’s overseas potential,” Lee said.

However, there will likely be short-term weakness in shares today given the equity placement, Lee said.

The fundraising comes as the competition in the new energy vehicles industry is intensifying. BYD has been widening its lead over Tesla in artificial-intelligence-powered driving technology for Chinese car buyers, with the introduction of a new system for low-price mass-market vehicles.

The advances by BYD and other Chinese automakers contrast with Tesla’s inability to release its latest driver-assistance software in China, owing to what Chief Executive Elon Musk described in January as regulatory hurdles.

AI-powered software for autonomous driving is evolving quickly in China, the world’s largest EV market. Startups XPeng and Li Auto as well as supplier Huawei Technologies and others have all brought to the market sophisticated driving-assistance technology.

BYD sold 3.7 million passenger cars in China in 2024, up 37% from the prior year. Tesla’s sales in comparison rose 9% to around 660,000 cars. Globally, BYD is nipping at Tesla’s heels as the largest maker of full EVs.

The new tariffs on imported goods ended decades of free trade among the three countries, and stood to disrupt entire industries.

The tariffs have the potential to profoundly reshape relations between the U.S. and its two largest trading partners, abruptly reversing America’s decadeslong project of expanding free trade with its allies.
This could also slow a U.S. economy that is already absorbing the effects of mass federal job cuts, reduced government spending and immigration restrictions, while raising prices on an array of goods as varied as autos and avocados.

The 25% tariffs have been levied on imports from Mexico and Canada, with the exception of energy products such as crude oil and natural gas, which will be tariffed at 10%. Canada said it would impose retaliatory tariffs, while Canada’s province of Ontario also said it would impose a 25% export tax on electricity it sends to 1.5 million U.S. homes. Mexico’s president said it would also retaliate, with a range of moves to be announced Sunday.Beyond tariffs on Mexico and Canada, Trump in recent weeks has placed an additional 20% levy on China.

The tariffs mark an escalation in trade tensions virtually unprecedented in U.S. history, said Douglas Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College. “Rarely have we ever seen such a large volume of imports with such a large increase in tariffs,” he said.

The Trump administration has cited the flow of drugs and undocumented immigrants across the U.S. border as justification for tariffs. Trump also has said tariffs would lead to more manufacturing in the U.S. “So they’re going to have a tariff, and what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things, in the United States, in which case you have no tariffs,” he said Monday.

Lower growth, higher prices
Economists at the Budget Lab at Yale calculate that if the tariffs remain in place, and Canada, Mexico and China enact tit-for-tat, matching tariffs on U.S. goods, they will add 1.2% to overall consumer prices over the next year.
Poorer people are most exposed because they spend a greater share of income on day-to-day items, the Budget Labs economists said. They also estimate that the tariffs would take 0.6 percentage point out of GDP growth this year.

Evercore ISI strategists forecast an even larger, 1 percentage point drag on GDP this year, while also saying the impact could wind up being worse. It is challenging to forecast the impact to tightly integrated North American supply chains.

That combination of slower growth and faster price increases could put Federal Reserve policymakers in a tricky spot, limiting their scope for cutting rates in response to economic weakness.

Joe LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities and a former special assistant to President Trump, said tariffs will ultimately benefit the economy despite some short-term pain by incentivizing manufacturing to move to the U.S., especially when combined with corporate tax cuts and deregulation. “Everything worth doing is generally hard,” he said.
Uncertainty effect
Even if tariffs are quickly lifted, they may continue to weigh on growth. “Most consumers are still going to be on edge,” said Cris deRitis, deputy chief economist at Moody’s. “That uncertainty is really doing the greatest damage,” deRitis said.

This could further damp the economy. Unsure of how long tariffs will stay in place, or the scope for additional tariffs against places such as Japan and countries in the European Union, businesses’ ability to plan could be constrained, making it harder for them to invest and hire.A trade-policy uncertainty index from economists Scott Baker, Nick Bloom and Steven Davis, based on news articles that discuss policy-related economic uncertainty with reference to trade policy, last month hit its highest level on record.Companies were already complaining about tariff disruptions in regional Federal Reserve manufacturing surveys. “This is a time of uncertainty for manufacturers, very difficult to make business plans,” one respondent said in a Kansas City Fed survey released last week.

This comes as the economy is hit by other forces, including mass layoffs of federal workers, cutbacks to government-funded programs and restrictions on immigration.

Monday’s report on February manufacturing from the Institute for Supply Management was riddled with mentions of tariffs. Among the comments included in that report: “Customers are pausing on new orders as a result of uncertainty regarding tariffs. There is no clear direction from the administration on how they will be implemented, so it’s harder to project how they will affect business.” The ISM’s index of manufacturing activity fell slightly in February, indicating a slowdown in manufacturing growth.

Stocks fell Tuesday, adding to losses that came Monday after President Trump confirmed the tariffs were coming and driving the S&P 500 below its closing level on Election Day. Stock market declines can also damage consumer and business confidence, while tightening the financial conditions companies face.

Companies are scrambling
The auto industry, with supply chains stretching across all three countries, is particularly at risk. On Ford Motor’s earnings call last month, Chief Executive Jim Farley warned that protracted 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico “would have a huge impact on our industry, with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out.”

Tuesday, Target warned that its sales could be flat this year because of consumer uncertainty and escalating tariffs. Also on Tuesday, Best Buy chief executive Corie Barry cautioned that the company expects its vendors “will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely.”

Some companies are planning to shoulder costs, at least for now.

Chipotle Mexican Grill, for example, said it expects tariffs imposed on Mexican imports like avocados could weigh on its profit margins this year. The company on Monday said it aims to absorb potential cost increases, rather than raising customer prices, due to uncertainty about how long the tariffs could last.

A rare trade move
The U.S. has raised tariffs on major trading partners in the past, but increases tended to be gradual, said Irwin, the Dartmouth economist who wrote the book “Clashing Over Commerce: A History of U.S. Trade Policy.” Substantial tariff hikes such as the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930 affected a smaller part of the U.S. economy because some goods were exempt and because the country was less trade-dependent then, Irwin said.

Irwin said the new tariffs are one of the biggest trade shake-ups since 1807, when Congress implemented a virtually universal embargo on foreign trade in response to interceptions of U.S. ships by British forces during the Napoleonic Wars. “It was enormously destructive to the U.S. economy,” he said."

1641 GMT – Base metal prices are mixed, with LME three-month copper down 0.5% at $9,352.50 a metric ton and LME three-month aluminum up 0.15% at $2,616 a ton. Copper prices have slid nearly $200 a ton since President Trump called for an inquiry into possible tariffs on copper imports, SP Angel analysts say in a note. This triggered wide spreads in prices between the U.S. and the LME, with U.S. commodities exchange Comex copper prices now trading at a 10% premium on tariff expectations, SP Angel writes. That said, copper market fundamentals remain relatively shaky, with a substantial ramp-up in refined copper recently, analysts say.

The small Wisconsin company has raised prices twice this year on some products. Tormach also asked a landlord to alter a lease. Then it told staff of roughly 100 employees that it was reducing 401(k) matches and eliminating some bonuses.

Tormach had thought it was prepared for a moment like this. The company tried to get ahead of a potential trade war by shifting production from China to Mexico, where it bought a factory in 2023. In August, it boosted its stockpile of Chinese-made goods by 20% to blunt the possibility of fresh China tariffs, squeezing its cash flow. It sped up plans to triple production in Mexico.

New tariffs on Mexico and China, in addition to those announced on China in early February, would be a worst-case scenario for Tormach, Chief Executive Daniel Rogge said last month. “A prolonged trade war with both Mexico and China is a severe blow to our business model,” he wrote to employees.

Small-business confidence plummeted in February, posting the largest monthly drop since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a survey of more than 400 businesses conducted for The Wall Street Journal by Vistage Worldwide. Fifty-four percent of those polled said that tariffs would negatively affect their companies, while just 11% said they would benefit, according to Vistage, a business-coaching and peer-advisory firm.

2025-03-04 10:30:00+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/articles/store-brand-supplier-feels-the-pain-as-shoppers-pull-back-even-on-lower-cost-groceries-fc450349,"First, shoppers squeezed by inflation began ditching name-brand snacks and drinks in favor of lower-price store brands. But now, with costs for coffee, eggs and other basic grocery items surging, consumers are cutting out many cheaper items as well. That has TreeHouse Foods, one of the country’s largest manufacturers of private brands, feeling the pinch.

The maker of cookies, crackers, coffee and other goods for retailers such as Walmart, Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s and Target, gained ground in recent quarters as inflation pushed shoppers into cheaper food options. With sales growth now slowing significantly, TreeHouse is working to protect its margins by slashing costs and fine-tuning its list of products, anticipating that shoppers will remain stretched, at least for now.

“We don’t have any strong indicators that consumers are going to be less stressed in the near term,” said TreeHouse finance chief Patrick O’Donnell. “If that’s not true and it turns around, I think doing the cost work benefits you either way.” Grocery retailers typically rely on third parties like TreeHouse to make their store-branded items. With giants like Walmart, Kroger, Albertsons and Costco Wholesale boosting investments in their branded products, private labels were growing faster than name-brand goods heading into the pandemic. Then, consumers stuck at home with money to spend, went back to the national brands they were familiar with and that were, at times, more available on store shelves than some generic options. 

Lower-cost brands have seen a resurgence again for a couple of reasons. Aside from higher grocery prices squeezing shoppers, retailers are expanding their store-brand offerings. Walmart, for one, introduced a premium line of food called Bettergoods alongside its Great Value brand. 

Shoppers still want private-label chips, cookies and crackers, but their appetite for them is slowing, TreeHouse executives said recently. Industrywide, private-label unit sales in categories where TreeHouse sells its products, which also include pickles, candy, nondairy creamer and in-store bakery goods, grew 0.6% for the three months ended in late December, compared with a year earlier. Unit sales were up 4.5% in the first three months of last year, according to TreeHouse.

“People continue to move to private labels, and we’re taking some share, but you’re just seeing lower category growth,” O’Donnell said. “So we’re pivoting a little bit of the mentality, at least in the near term, to say, ‘The consumer is uncertain, let’s go control the things we can control to help drive profit.’”

That means slashing supply-chain spending in a few ways. TreeHouse is working with suppliers of ingredients and packaging materials to bring costs down. The company is also speeding up the time it takes to produce sweets, snacks and drinks in its factories with efficiencies such as automated case packing. TreeHouse aims to reduce its gross supply-chain costs by $250 million over a period of four years ending in 2027. 

Meanwhile, prices and packaging are under the microscope to ensure customers get the size offerings and price variety they want, as is TreeHouse’s list of products.

In some areas, the company is expanding. These include its approximately $100 million acquisition of certain coffee operations from Farmer Brothers in 2023 and its roughly $205 million purchase of Harris Tea, which closed in January. Meanwhile, TreeHouse is getting out of some businesses, most recently exiting from a ready-to-drink business that O’Donnell said largely consists of discretionary purchases for consumers and is an area where branded labels have a better foothold.“You may see us step away from a few things in the year,” according to the CFO. This will likely affect specific products rather than overall categories, he said, declining to provide specifics. 

Analysts are looking for smoother operations from TreeHouse. After taking its broth facility offline for maintenance and upgrades in 2023, the company struggled to bring it back to full production, weighing on sales. A voluntary recall of frozen griddle products such as waffles added another drag. Net sales in the quarter ended in December were down 0.6%, the fifth consecutive quarter of declines.

“They need to execute better,” said William Blair research analyst Jon Andersen. “No more plant-related issues. No more recalls.” 

The company’s focus this year on eliminating costs and improving profitability, while not racing to drive sales at any cost, makes sense in a softer demand environment, analysts said. That means slower growth: TreeHouse expects adjusted net sales in the first three months of the year to be down around 3.5% compared with a year earlier.

But it is a needed, and temporary, pivot, according to Andersen. “You have to live with the environment you’re operating in,” he said. “And that’s what they’ve done this year.” "

JPMorgan Chase and Starwood Property Trust have agreed to lend $2 billion for the 100-acre data center campus in West Jordan, Utah, outside Salt Lake City. 

The borrower, a venture of real-estate investor CIM Group and Novva Data Centers, said the facility will be able to provide 175 megawatts of continuous service thanks to a power deal with the local electric utility. That is roughly enough juice to power 175,000 average-size U.S. homes.

The loan marks the second data center construction loan of more than $2 billion this year, following a $2.3 billion loan in January from JPMorgan Chase for a facility in Abilene, Texas. Until recently nearly every data center construction loan was less than $1 billion, and typically amounted to less than half of that. 

Now, lenders are starting to write much bigger checks because data centers are getting much larger to serve AI, which consumes more advanced chips and more power. Data centers are also increasingly getting commitments from big-name tenants before breaking ground, rather than building on a speculative basis with little preleasing.“It’s evolving fast,” said Jordy Roeschlaub, co-president of global debt and structured finance at Newmark, which arranged the Abilene deal.

More than 6.3 gigawatts—or 6,300 megawatts—of data center capacity was under construction in the top eight markets at the end of 2024. That was more than double the amount of a year earlier, according to CBRE Group.

Data centers are also popping in parts of the country they never did before.

Tech companies like to locate their servers near large population centers, major fiber-optic networks, and other tech and telecommunications company servers. But these markets in places such as northern Virginia, Atlanta and Chicago have run into power and land limitations and public opposition. 

Developers and “hyperscalers” such as Amazon.com and Microsoft are now moving where they can find sufficient power, water and friendly local governments. 

Meta recently said it is planning a $10 billion data center in Richland Parish, La. Google last year broke ground on a pair of data centers in Dorchester County, S.C., as part of a major expansion effort in that state.   New data centers are focused on markets with “the ability to deliver power in scale and jurisdictions that can fast-track it,” said Roy March, chief executive of real-estate investment banking firm Eastdil Secured.

Novva founder and CEO Wes Swenson was early to the Utah market, acquiring the site near Salt Lake City in 2018. Swenson formed Novva in 2019 with CIM, which has a range of infrastructure and commercial real-estate projects in Europe and the Americas. 

CIM and Novva began constructing the first phase of the facility in 2020 without any signed leases because Utah wasn’t a big data center market and some of their new data center technologies were untested, said Avi Shemesh, CIM co-founder and principal. “We had to prove our design,” he said.

The first phase opened in 2023 with the rest opening by the end of 2026, and it is already fully leased, the developers said. Utah is a good location for data centers because the region has a low risk from earthquakes and other natural disasters, Swenson said. 

But Utah and other Western states have one big drawback: The region is dry. Obtaining enough water to prevent a data center from overheating is a major challenge. "

The retailer’s sales in February fell year-over-year because of “declining consumer confidence” and cold weather, Target finance chief Jim Lee said. Those sales trends should tick up as weather warms and the Easter holiday spurs buying, Lee said, but the retailer “will remain appropriately cautious with our expectations for the year ahead.” 

U.S. consumer confidence is slipping in part because of fears that the Trump administration’s tariff campaign could raise prices. Walmart executives spooked investors last month when they set fiscal-year revenue and profit targets below analysts’ expectations.

Target said comparable sales, those from stores and websites operating at least 12 months, rose 1.5% in the three months ended Feb 1. That was in line with what the company predicted in January when it reported holiday sales results. Profit also came in largely as expected. That growth was driven by stronger sales of beauty products and some big sales over the winter holidays, as well as through same-day delivery.

The sales and profit figures are the latest in a string of lackluster results from Target in recent years. The retailer has reported sluggish sales since 2022. People pulled back on spending because of high inflation, and the chain disappointed some shoppers with its product selection, antitheft measures and pricing. 

Consumers have gravitated toward retailers such as Walmart, Amazon and Costco that are known for low prices or fast shipping on lots of items. In the year ended Feb. 1, Target’s sales fell compared with the previous year for all categories of goods except apparel and accessories, beauty items and advertising revenue. The previous year included an additional week. Target’s net sales shrank by 0.8% for the full year to $106.6 billion. 

“We believe that Target needs to invest more in pricing and promotions to drive the top-line growth,” Zhihan Ma, a retail analyst at Bernstein, wrote in a research note ahead of Target’s earnings report. Target reduced the price of more than 10,000 items last year, the company said Tuesday.

Target said its comparable e-commerce sales rose 8.7% in the latest quarter, while sales from stores fell 0.5%. Target will host an investor day Tuesday in New York, where executives are likely to share more about the company’s strategy."

Concerns that an escalating trade war will dent energy demand saw crude prices fall for a third session Tuesday.

Futures for Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, fell toward $70 a barrel, a level they haven't dipped below since September. Lower crude prices can feed quickly into cheaper gas at the pump.

There are additional reasons for the decline, though, including OPEC+'s announcement Monday that it will boost oil output. Plus, the impact of tariffs on U.S. energy markets is nuanced. When Trump first threatened tariffs on Canada, oil prices rose, because America's northern neighbor is a major crude exporter to the Midwest."

Those products have been subject to antidumping tariffs since 2011, the ministry said. Such measures are designed to stop countries dumping excess production in overseas markets, pushing down prices and hurting competitors.

The investigation follows a complaint by a Chinese company. The ministry didn’t give any detail on the exact infraction or identify the U.S. companies involved. Chinese state media said this was Beijing’s first probe of suspected antidumping violations."

For 2025, the company said it intends to deliver solid, sustainable and above-market growth. However, Chief Executive Andrea Guerra cautioned that complex industry dynamics are likely to persist.

The luxury fashion group, which houses its namesake brand and Miu Miu, said Tuesday that it made revenue of 5.43 billion euros ($5.70 billion) for 2024, 17% higher that the prior year at constant currency. The result beat analysts’ expectations of 5.37 billion euros, according to a poll of estimates compiled by Visible Alpha.

Net profit jumped 25% on year to 839 million euros, also surpassing analysts’ projections of 812.6 million euros.

Prada has been one of the few companies to buck a slowdown in demand for pricey goods, helped by a significant acceleration in momentum of Miu Miu.

The label, founded in 1993 by Prada designer Miuccia Prada, achieved a record year, with organic growth of 93% for 2024 as a whole. In the fourth quarter alone, it recorded growth of 84% compared with the prior-year period.

The brand’s designs ring well with Asian consumers, at a time when most luxury names contend with waning demand in China, once a growth driver for the industry. The country is currently immersed in an economic malaise that has prompted particularly middle-income shoppers to be more cost-effective.

Prada said it aims to consolidate the success of Miu Miu. In February, it named Silvia Onofri as the brand’s CEO, replacing Benedetta Petruzzo, who was appointed by LVMH’s Christian Dior Couture as managing director in September last year.

The group’s namesake brand posted a 4% increase in retail sales for the last three months of 2024, marking an acceleration compared with the prior quarter.

“We will continue to sharpen the positioning of our brands, to enrich product portfolios and to foster customer engagement,” CEO Guerra said.

Prada’s update comes amid rumors that the group could be interested in acquiring Italian brand Versace from luxury group Capri Holdings. Earlier this week, the Financial Times reported that Prada could buy the label for around 1.5 billion euros, citing unnamed sources.

The earnings season raised hopes of a potential sector recovery, driven by strong demand in the U.S., following a period of slowdown in demand for high-end goods after a postpandemic spending euphoria came to an end.

Hermes, Cartier owner Richemont, and U.K. trench-coat maker Burberry reported positive trends in the Americas, a region that has become a spotlight for the luxury industry given weak trends in China.

Hong Kong-listed Prada proposed a dividend of 0.164 euros a share."

Beijing announced a series of new tariffs on American products as well as controls on U.S. companies just as the White House’s additional 10% levy on all Chinese products came into effect.Meanwhile, Beijing set a growth target of about 5% for 2025, a signal that it expects the Chinese economy to resist the rising trade pressures coming from Washington. The government also set a deficit target of around 4% of gross domestic product, the highest level in years, suggesting that authorities intend to unleash more stimulus for an economy that was already in the doldrums before the renewed trade war.

China is more dependent on exports as a driver of economic growth than it has been for most of the past two decades, making its economy vulnerable in an escalating trade war with the U.S.

In response to the new U.S. tariffs, Beijing said it would impose an additional 15% tariff on U.S. chicken, wheat, corn and cotton products, and an additional 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruits, vegetables and dairy products. The new tariffs from China are set to go into effect on March 10.

Simultaneously, the Commerce Ministry said it added more than two dozen American companies to export control and corporate blacklists and opened an investigation into the sale of certain optical fiber products by U.S. manufacturers. China said it has also filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization against the U.S.’s new tariff increase.China’s burst of retaliatory measures comes after President Trump put an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports on Tuesday on top of an extra 10% levy it placed on Chinese products last month. The U.S. leader has sparked fears of a protracted trade war, after hiking tariffs on Mexican, Canadian and China imports in response to what he says is a failure of those countries to fight the trafficking of fentanyl into America.

Analysts say China’s response so far to tariffs has been targeted and measured, signaling Beijing is prepared to counter Trump’s trade penalties while leaving room for negotiation.

“It’s still a very muted response to U.S. tariffs,” said ANZ Research senior China strategist Zhaopeng Xing. “It’s not a broad tariff on the U.S.”

China’s retaliatory agricultural tariffs put pressure on a major export market for U.S. farmers. China was the U.S.’s third-largest destination for agricultural exports last year, totaling about $24.7 billion in value, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. It is by far the U.S.’s largest buyer of soybeans, purchasing about $12.8 billion in 2024, according to the USDA.

On Tuesday, China’s Commerce Ministry unveiled a range of actions, signaling to the Trump administration that it could retaliate in asymmetrical ways.Beijing also added 10 American companies to China’s “unreliable entity” list. These firms are prohibited from exporting or importing in China or from making new investments in the country, according to the commerce authority.

U.S. biotech company Illumina, which had been added to the “unreliable entity” list in retaliation for Trump’s first round of tariffs in February, will be prohibited from exporting gene sequencers to China, the ministry said in another statement.

Chinese authorities also opened a probe into some optical-fiber products from the U.S. over allegations that American companies might have circumvented Beijing’s antidumping measures.China has also filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization against the U.S.’s additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods, according to the Commerce Ministry. That follows a dispute China raised with the WTO in February against the U.S.’s previous tariff increase.Later on Tuesday, China’s customs agency said it was suspending imports of wood from the U.S., and U.S. soybean imports from three companies.

In February, China responded to the previous tariff increase with levies on select U.S. products, export controls on key minerals and an antitrust probe into Google.

Analysts said the Chinese response was partly symbolic.

Fourteen of the 25 American firms added to the export control and entity lists on Tuesday were already sanctioned by China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs last year, a move the ministry said was linked to the U.S. agreeing to sell arms to Taiwan, a self-governed island Beijing views as its own territory. The sanctions meant the companies were blocked from doing business with China and would have any assets within China frozen.

“These sanctions are old wine in new bottles,” said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “Some of these companies have been sanctioned more than once.”

Thompson said the laws would have little impact, as American defense contractors have been prevented from selling technology and equipment to China by export controls for decades. Instead, the moves will likely push these companies to ensure their supply chains aren’t dependent on Chinese raw materials and components, he added.

Illumina said that it is assessing the effect on its China operations, adding the decision “does not ban Illumina from operating in China.” The country accounts for about 7% of the company’s revenue.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said Tuesday that if the U.S. “insists on launching a tariff war, a trade war or any other war, China will fight to the end.”"

“Our deep concern is that this could be the start of a downward spiral that puts us in 1930s trade-war territory,” said Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary-general of the ICC, which promotes global business and trade. High tariffs on foreign goods imported into the U.S. in that decade contributed to a damaging global recession. The downturn plunged nearly a third of the global workforce into unemployment and slashed production at heavyweight industrial economies Germany and the U.S. by half, according to research from the International Monetary Fund.

The likelihood of a similarly severe blow to the global economy is high, Wilson said in an interview Tuesday. “Right now it’s a coin-flip,” he said. “It comes down to whether the U.S. administration is willing to rethink the utility of tariffs.”

His comments come after tariffs of 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico came into effect in the U.S., stymieing hopes of an eleventh-hour reprieve. Fresh duties were also added to Chinese goods sold to the country. Trump has promised to impose similar tariffs on European goods, raising the prospect of retaliation in kind and a global trade war.

“That puts us in a remarkably precarious position that will cloud the global economy for the coming months,” Wilson said.

President Trump was voted into office in November after a campaign centred on pledges to protect U.S. manufacturers by raising the barrier for imports into the country from abroad. Trump has repeatedly pointed to the U.S. deficit in its good trade with many partners, including China and the EU, calling those gaps unfair. But economists warn that a steep rise in import costs could cause a renewed spike in price inflation in the U.S.

“There is a real risk to [American] domestic economy of taking a tariff-led approach,” Wilson said. Many U.S. trade-sensitive stocks suffered sell-offs Monday after Trump reiterated his tariff plans."

The company last year agreed to buy German plastics maker Covestro 1COV -0.78%decrease; red down pointing triangle for about $13 billion.

The all-share deal between Adnoc and OMV will create a new company called Borouge Group International that combines their shareholdings in Borouge and Borealis, the companies said Tuesday. Borealis is 75% owned by OMV, while Adnoc owns 25%. Borealis, in turn, holds a 36% interest in Borouge, which is majority owned by Adnoc with a 54% stake.

Nova Chemicals will cost the new entity $13.4 billion including debt.

OMV will inject 1.6 billion euros ($1.68 billion) in cash into the business to put its shareholding on par with Adnoc, they said. Subsequently, Adnoc and OMV will both hold 46.94% stakes in Borouge Group, with the remaining 6.12% in free float, the companies said.

Borouge Group will be headquartered in Vienna and listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, they added.

In connection to the deal, Adnoc agreed to buy Nova Chemicals from Mubadala Investment, a United Arab Emirates sovereign-wealth fund. Once the deal to create Borouge Group is completed, the business will acquire Nova Chemicals to expand its presence in North America, the companies said.

When including Nova Chemicals, Borouge Group will have a combined enterprise value of slightly more than $60 billion and debt in the multi-billion dollar range, an Adnoc spokesperson said.

The enlarged Borouge Group will rank as the fourth-largest producer of polyolefins by capacity behind Sinopec, China National Petroleum Corp. and ExxonMobil, Adnoc and OMV said.

The proposed transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions and are expected to be closed in the first quarter of 2026, the companies said.

Adnoc said its stake in Borouge Group will be transferred upon completion to its XRG business, which houses its lower-carbon energy and energy investments. The company has previously said XRG aims to be one of the top five players in the global chemicals market. XRG is also set to be home to Covestro once that deal is closed."

The details 
The deal is expected to value Quorum at $2.4 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. A transaction was announced Tuesday, confirming an earlier report from The Wall Street Journal. 

Houston-based Quorum’s software helps customers across energy sectors in areas including financial planning, well management and land management, according to its website. 

Thoma bought Quorum from private-equity firm Silver Lake for an undisclosed amount in 2018. 

Quorum scaled quickly under Thoma’s ownership. The business pursued deals, including a merger with a Thoma portfolio company, Aucerna, and acquisition of Energy Components, a piece of the Finnish software business Tietoevry, to create a bigger leader in the energy software space. 

The context 
Other deals between buyout firms have been struck this week.

Clearlake Capital said Monday it would buy a stake in healthcare software firm Modernizing Medicine, from Warburg Pincus. Genstar Capital also announced a deal for a controlling stake in First Eagle Investment Management, from its private-equity backers Blackstone and Corsair Capital. 

Overall activity is at multidecade lows, however. Deal announcements in the first two months of the year were down over 26% from 2024, according to Dealogic. It is the fewest deal announcements over the same period since 2005. 

Francisco Partners focuses its investments on technology and technology-enabled businesses. 

About a year ago, it bought Jama Software from shareholders including Insight Partners and Madrona Ventures for $1.2 billion. 

“Francisco Partners had already done a lot of work in the sector before we connected, and so this made a nice match,” Quorum CEO Paul Langenbahn said in an interview.

2025-03-04 15:00:00+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/taxes/salt-deducation-cap-taxpayers-guide-43881cb3,"As Congress debates tax policy this year, the state and local tax-deduction cap is in the crosshairs.

The SALT deduction cap is set to expire at year’s end, along with a host of other tax-policy changes enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Currently, households that itemize may deduct up to $10,000 of property, sales or income taxes paid to state and local governments.

Before 2017, there was no limit to how much in state and local taxes taxpayers could deduct from their federally taxable income. This limit hit high-income people who live in states with high state and local tax rates, such as New York, California and Connecticut. To partially offset capping the state and local tax deduction, Congress doubled the standard deduction (currently $29,200 for married filing jointly)—causing many people who previously itemized and took the SALT deduction to use the elevated standard deduction.

President Trump on the campaign trail called for restoring the tax break. And several lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, primarily from high-tax states where residents are affected by the deduction cap, have proposed modifications, including doubling the current cap, increasing it to $20,000 for married filing jointly, or eliminating it. 

It isn’t clear how the SALT deduction cap will play out this year, but one of three scenarios will occur: it’s modified, allowed to expire, or is made permanent. Whatever happens, here is how financial professionals say taxpayers can prepare.A modified cap may be the likeliest outcome, financial pros say, but how much it is adjusted matters.

For taxpayers in the highest tax bracket—currently 37%—who itemize their deductions, the SALT cap of $10,000 means a decrease of $3,700 on a tax bill. Some lawmakers suggest doubling the deduction to $20,000. That would decrease the taxpayer’s bill by $7,400, says Jason Katz, wealth adviser and certified public accountant at Bartlett Wealth Management in Cincinnati.

While not insignificant, a $3,700 or $7,400 tax break may not make much of a difference for high-income earners. If the cap is lifted to $100,000 for single filers, which is one proposal, the tax cut is $37,000, or $33,300 more compared with current law, Katz says; the same proposal would increase the cap to $200,000 for married couples filing jointly, doubling the tax cut to $74,000. A higher cap could allow more people to itemize and make a bigger difference for high-income earners.

Once policy is made final, this may be the year that people who use tax preparers to file their annual taxes should schedule a fourth-quarter meeting to review how the new laws will affect them. If the policy is settled early enough, there are opportunities to maximize deductions by making moves such as postponing income or expenses for the following year, says Miklos Ringbauer, founder of MiklosCPA, in Southern California. 

It’s also a chance to do tax planning around major life events such as getting married, moving, or retiring now or in the next few years. Tax preparers can run scenarios that show different tax implications of these events and offer guidance to potentially reduce tax burdens.

If the SALT cap expires, state and local income taxes would be fully deductible again on Internal Revenue Service form Schedule A, where taxpayers itemize deductions. 

Kat Grier, wealth adviser and CPA at Merit Financial Advisors in Atlanta, says taxpayers should watch the policy effective date, since state, local and property taxes are deducted in the year paid, which may differ from the year when they were assessed.If policy reverts to pre-2017 levels on Jan. 1, 2026, for example, taxpayers should defer paying as much of their state income taxes as possible until January, says Bill Smith, national director of tax technical services at CBIZ’s national tax office, in Washington, D.C. Taxpayers who opt for this strategy should keep in mind that there may be a penalty for underpayment of the 2025 state estimated tax payments; however, if the cap is eliminated, the penalty may be offset by a larger federal deduction in 2026. 

Grier added that, if possible, people who directly pay their property taxes to their municipality instead of their mortgage company should also defer until January to capture the deduction. If the law is made to be retroactive to December, deferring payments won’t matter, she adds.

Grier warns that eliminating the SALT cap won’t be all good news if the income threshold for the alternative minimum tax—which was designed to reduce a taxpayer’s ability to avoid taxes by using deductions or other tax benefits—reverts to previous levels. The current AMT income threshold is about $1.15 million for a married couple filing jointly, but pre-2017 the income threshold was $160,900. If the AMT income threshold reverts to previous levels, high-income taxpayers may see little benefit from SALT deductions."

In response to President Trump’s initial tariff measures, the Chinese government added the maker of gene-sequencing equipment to its list of “unreliable entities.”

Now Beijing is going further. Retaliating against the White House’s latest 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, China's government said Illumina will be barred from exporting gene sequencers to China.

Illumina stock, which had tumbled 5% Monday, fell further on Tuesday morning. That took its year-to-date decline to about 40%.

Just as important, however, as what China said is what it didn’t say. The ban doesn't explicitly stop Illumina from selling reagents, the consumables required to operate its machines, noted Leerink Partners analyst Puneet Souda. That means it may still generate some sales in China.

An Illumina spokeswoman said it was assessing the impact on its China operations. She said the company wasn't banned from operating in China, and would continue to serve customers there.

Why is China targeting Illumina? Analysts cite two key reasons. First, Beijing was reportedly angered by Illumina’s lobbying efforts in Washington to restrict Chinese competitors. More significantly, China has long sought to bolster its own biotech sector, and gene-sequencing technology is foundational to that ambition.

At this stage, it is fair to ask how much worse can things get for a company that is still highly profitable and dominates the gene-sequencing market.

The shares are down some 70% over the past five years. The stock price has plummeted from about 100 times expected earnings a year ago to just 18 times today. China is an important market but accounts for just 7% of revenue—a share that has been declining in recent years.

Illumina’s stock may be nearing a point of opportunity."

The deal with Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison is worth $22.8 billion and also includes dozens of other ports around the world, the companies said Tuesday.

Trump had flagged the Panama ports as a threat even though the canal is run and controlled by Panama. His administration argued China could force the two terminals, which handled 40% of all containers that crossed the waterway last year, to restrict American-bound ships. 

In recent months, Trump also threatened to take control of the canal, potentially by military force, saying the U.S. “foolishly gave it away” and was getting “ripped off.” On Tuesday night in his address to Congress, Trump repeated his threat to take over the canal.

“We’re taking it back,” he said, to cheers from Republican lawmakers.

“China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn’t give it to China,” Trump said in his inaugural address, referring to the 1977 treaty that handed control of it to Panama.

American opposition to the current ownership structure centers on concerns China could use the ports for military purposes, including monitoring ship movements or possibly sabotaging the waterway. Panamanian officials, and several former U.S. military officials, have said the facilities don’t represent a military threat from China or breach the canal’s neutrality.

BlackRock has briefed the Trump administration and Congress on the deal, said a person familiar with the matter. A spokesman for China’s embassy in Washington referred questions to the companies, while describing the canal as a neutral international waterway.

The U.S. built the Panama Canal, which opened in 1914, and relinquished it to Panama in late 1999 under a treaty negotiated more than 20 years earlier with then-President Jimmy Carter. Trump has long said the deal was bad for the U.S. and has complained about the fees Panama charges and Chinese infrastructure built up along the waterway.

The deal appears to mark a retreat from international port operations by Hutchison, controlled by one of Asia’s richest people, 96-year-old Li Ka-shing. The group, which faced pressure from officials in the U.S. and Panama to divest itself of the Panama ports, will retain its ports in Hong Kong and in mainland China while selling control of 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries."

Economists warn that tariffs will push up prices for American businesses and consumers. That could weigh on loan growth at banks, cause borrowers to fall behind on payments and put upward pressure on interest rates, analysts say.

Meantime, Trump took aim at Canadian banks again Tuesday. In a social-media post, he said Canada “doesn’t allow American Banks to do business” there, while its lenders “flood the American Market.”

Karl Schamotta, strategist at Corpay, a foreign-exchange and global payments company, warned that this unexpected stability in these notoriously volatile markets may not last.

“While Best Buy only directly imports 2% to 3% of our overall assortment, we expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely,” said Chief Executive Corie Barry.

China and Mexico are the top two sources for products the consumer-electronics store chain relies on. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada took effect. Canada responded with plans to impose 25% tariffs on nearly $100 billion of U.S. imports, and Mexico’s president said it would also retaliate.

The U.S. also introduced an extra 10% tariff on Chinese imports overnight, adding to a levy imposed a month ago, and other existing duties. China swiftly announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods, and other measures against American companies

The measures threaten to cause consumers to further delay purchases on computers, video game consoles and other big-ticket electronics. Best Buy and other electronics retailers expected demand for PCs to pick up with overdue upgrades, while also anticipating sales would benefit from anticipated releases including Nintendo’s new gaming console and Take-Two Interactive Software’s “Grand Theft Auto VI.”

Shares tumbled 14% to $74.55 in midday trading. The stock is down nearly 4% over the last year.

Best Buy on Tuesday reported higher-than-expected sales in its latest quarter and said consumers are looking for value, but are still willing to spend on high-priced electronics. The company said its guidance for the fiscal year doesn’t include the impact of recently implemented or proposed tariffs.

The Minneapolis chain forecast full-year revenue between $41.4 billion and $42.2 billion, as well as adjusted earnings per-share in the range of $6.20 to $6.60. Wall Street expects revenue around $41.75 billion and adjusted earnings of $6.58 a share

Comparable sales are expected to range between flat to 2% growth for the year, with growth weighted more to the second half of the year.

Still, the market for PCs has begun to improve as consumers and businesses alike look to replace older models they have held onto for longer than average in response to a run-up in prices.

For the quarter ended Feb. 1, Best Buy reported earnings of $117 million, or 54 cents a share, down from $460 million, or $2.12 a share, in the prior-year period.

Stripping out certain one-time items, earnings came in at $2.58 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected $2.40 a share.

Revenue declined to $13.95 billion from $14.65 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected $13.68 billion."

The blue-chip average tumbled 1.6%, or about 670 points, leaving it down 23 points for the year. The S&P 500 declined 1.2%, wiping out gains since Election Day, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%.

Investors struggled to discern what the new U.S. tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods and additional tariffs on Chinese imports—as well as countermeasures announced or expected from those countries—would mean for a wide variety of asset classes and the health of the economy. 

Stocks fell sharply Monday afternoon after Trump reiterated that the tariffs would take effect at 12:01 a.m. The slide continued on Tuesday before the market appeared to find its footing by midafternoon. Tech stocks pulled up the Nasdaq. Then came a final downdraft in the last hour of trading.   

“This is more of a market gyration based on uncertainty than anything else,” said Charles Lemonides, chief investment officer of ValueWorks, a hedge fund. “We’re in a period of policy transition, and we don’t know how far it is going to go.”

Just weeks ago, the stock market was trading at records. The S&P 500 notched its record close on Feb. 19, bringing it to a gain of 4.5% in 2025.

Since then, data has hinted at weakness in the economy: Consumer spending in January had its largest monthly drop in four years, while the Conference Board’s consumer-confidence index in February notched its biggest monthly decline since 2021.

“Investors are having some greater concern about growth fears in the U.S.,” said Roosevelt Bowman, senior investment strategist at Bernstein Private Wealth Management. “The economic fundamentals worsening quickly was the main driver. You think about the tariff and policy uncertainty as a secondary driver.”

Economically sensitive stocks were among the hardest hit on Tuesday, with the S&P 500’s financial sector slumping 3.5%. Bank of America shares fell 6.3%, while JPMorgan Chase shares dropped 4%.

Cruise lines, resorts and automakers fell, as did most industrial stocks. Caterpillar shares retreated 1.6%, while United Airlines slid 6%.

The market had rallied on Trump’s election, with investors betting the Republican president would champion tax cuts and deregulation. Many hoped the tariffs he described on the campaign trail were more negotiating positions than reality. On Tuesday, major new tariffs took effect.“People are waking up and saying, wait, this is a big thing,” said Max Wasserman, co-founder and senior portfolio manager at Miramar Capital. “He’s going to enforce it.”

The rich valuations of the tech-oriented Nasdaq left it vulnerable to a selloff, Wasserman said. He said his firm in recent months has trimmed positions in tech stocks and bought shares of healthcare, energy and staples companies.

The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, climbed 3.2%.

Brent crude is trading near a five-month low, down nearly 15% from a high of $82 a barrel in January. Mid-afternoon in Europe, it fell 2% to $70.19 a barrel, with the U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, down 1.6% to $67.27 a barrel.

Prices tumbled after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies on Monday agreed to start unwinding some of their voluntary output cuts starting from April, a surprise move that means more crude will hit the market.

The group had delayed plans to unwind its long-standing production cuts several times, and was expected to do so again. “Given the market was largely expecting another delay, oil prices are likely to remain under downward pressure,” analysts at ANZ Research said.

The group of oil producers, which is led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, is set to add around 138,000 barrels a day next month–the first of several monthly hikes that will bring back around 2.2 million barrels a day by 2026. Still, some analysts say OPEC+’s effective production increase could be lower as some members are due to implement cuts to production to compensate for past overproduction.

“Nevertheless, we continue to see scope for OPEC+ to manage the pace of this month to month, as the producer group noted this could be a gradual and flexible return,” analysts at Citi Research said. The U.S. bank expects Brent to fall to a range of $60-$65 a barrel in the next six-to-twelve months, with OPEC+’s additional supply providing more room for potential supply losses caused by U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.

According to Goldman Sachs, OPEC+’s decision to start raising output in April reflects lower global inventories and a shift in strategy to limit non-OPEC+ oil production growth. The bank warns that higher-than-expected supply and a potential demand hit due to softer U.S. activity and escalating tariffs pose downside risks to its oil price forecast.

Goldman projects Brent crude to average $78 and $73 a barrel in 2025 and 2026, respectively, and WTI at an average of around $74 and $68 a barrel in the same years.

The reason behind OPEC+’s move remains unclear, but the gradual output increase can be paused or reversed based on market conditions. Some analysts suggest the group is aiming to regain market share, while others say U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran might have played a significant role, as they are expected to lower global output.

Meanwhile, concerns over the impact of multiple trade wars on the global economy and crude demand are also weighing on prices after Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China.

The largest potential disruption to oil markets come from tariffs on Canada, as U.S. refiners in the Midwest are heavily dependent on Canadian oil. “The bulk of oil that is at risk from his sanctions and tariffs are medium and heavy grade crudes,” analysts at BMI said. “Pressures are already apparent in the market for this type of oil and further distortions could spillover into the wider crude complex.”"

The U.S. had a trade surplus in 2024 of roughly $100 billion from all the aircraft that it makes and sends out to other countries. Boeing is the biggest chunk of that business.

Boeing builds its jets, bombers and satellites exclusively in the U.S. The jet maker isn’t entirely immune. The aerospace industry would face higher costs of raw materials such as aluminum. In addition to a sprawling global supply chain, Boeing has a composite parts factory in Winnipeg, Canada. Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg has previously said that tariffs on China could dent sales to that nation.

Boeing is also somewhat protected from retaliatory tariffs given that it is one of two companies—along with European rival Airbus —that sells commercial jetliners globally at a time when the world’s airlines are clamoring for more planes. Boeing has a backlog of more than 6,000 airplanes, which amounts to more than a decades’ worth of production. Airbus has an even longer backlog."

David Dienesch tells The WSJ materials Canadians and Americans use in the building sector, including lumber and steel products, will be directly affected. He expects the food industry, which generally has a shorter-cycle supply chain, also will be impacted immediately. And the auto industry looks to be a direct target of the tariffs launched by President Trump, as well potentially cumulative tariffs. “The result of this will be inflationary effects at the grocery aisle on both sides of the border. Higher housing costs, including renovation costs, and higher costs for the purchase of both new and used vehicles are all to be expected.” (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)

Canadian auto parts maker Magna International says it is working to keep supply chains running smoothly. Magna is one of the session’s biggest decliners after tariffs were imposed by the U.S. at midnight. Shares of the C$14.2-billion market cap company are down 3.6% to C$49.43, recovering from a low of C$48.22. Magna is down 18% year-to-date. “Despite the immediate implementation of these tariffs, we are working with our partners, trade associations, and government stakeholders to find solutions that maintain industry stability and minimize supply chain disruptions,” a spokesperson tells the WSJ. “Our priority remains maintaining a stable work environment and ensuring our voice is heard in these critical discussions,” he adds.

Automakers operate on long-term product cycles so they won’t be able to quickly shift gears in reaction to tariffs, Edmunds head of insights Jessica Caldwell says. Car makers will have to move production to other regions or find alternative ways to offset higher costs. Still, “there’s no escaping the fact that higher costs will ultimately be passed on to consumers,” Caldwell says. The companies that make the largest share of their autos in Mexico and Canada are Volkswagen (45%), Honda (41%) and Nissan (35%), according to Edmunds data. Subaru and Mercedes-Benz make less than 5% of their products in those countries. (katherine.hamilton@wsj.com)

Travel demand may be affected by an economic “soft patch,” Deutsche Bank analysts say. Domestic leisure demand may be the most heavily impacted by any economic slowdown. “Some of this ‘softness’ could be a function of recent headlines which have not only increased consumer uncertainty, but could result in their hesitancy with respect to the purchase of goods and services (including airline tickets),” the analysts write. Big airlines like Delta, United and American are likely to fare the best as many of their customers are less price sensitive than those who rely on budget carriers, the analysts say.

 Trucker Saia says it’s handling more shipments so far this year. The less-than-truckload carrier reports a 13% increase in LTL tonnage per day for 1Q so far. LTL shipments per day were up 5.5% while LTL weight per shipment climbed 7.1%. Stephens analysts write the results are better than expected and that the quarter-to-date appears to be tracking ahead of the consensus forecast. Saia is off 2.8%. (liz.young@wsj.com)

Trucker Old Dominion Freight Line says ongoing weak freight demand is weighing on its revenue. The less-than-truckload carrier reports revenue per day fell 5% in February compared with the year-ago period. Old Dominion says that was due to a 7.1% drop in LTL tons per day that was partially offset by an increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. LTL shipments per day dropped 5.9% and LTL weight per shipments fell 1.3%. CEO Marty Freeman says the drop in revenue for February “reflects continued softness in the domestic economy as well as the impact of lower fuel prices on our yields.” (liz.young@wsj.com)

The amendment to EU carbon dioxide rules will offer only a small relief to European automakers, UBS analyst Patrick Hummel writes. The EU Commission has announced that CO2 targets for 2025-27 will be combined into one assessment period instead of assessing compliance each year, allowing carmakers to compensate for potential underachievement in 2025 with overachievement in following years. However, manufacturers will still have to sell more EVs this year, because a sit-back-and-relax strategy could be risky and costly in the coming years. Therefore, EV price competition will probably remain intense. “Volkswagen and Renault so far have been most behind their CO2 goals, and therefore the amendment to the rules is good news for them.” (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)

Stellantis faces a year of transition in 2025, but risks remain, Citi analysts Harald C Hendrikse and Soumava Banerjee write. The car maker’s full-year report provided context and perspective on the likely speed and magnitude of any earnings recovery, and there is plenty of scope for such a recovery. However, earnings will likely remain weak in the first half, ahead of any significant new product benefit, the analysts say. New products in the second half will only provide a limited benefit, while U.S. and possibly EU pricing this year will likely remain sharply negative on year, they add. The bank also sees no significant long-term margin recovery without more assertive cost reductions. Citi cuts its target price on the stock to 12 euros from 13 euros and keeps its rating at neutral. Shares fall 7.2%. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)

0620 ET – The EU’s altered rules on carbon dioxide emission compliance are a big win for automakers, but knock-on effects of higher defense spending are likely to be less helpful, Citi analysts Harald C Hendrikse and Soumava Banerjee write. The EU has announced that manufacturers will get a three-year window for EU CO2 emission compliance. At the very least, large financial penalties will be at least deferred until full-year 2028, Citi says. Further, this means auto manufacturers can properly maximize EBIT in 2025, providing around 5% upside for the most-exposed names. “On the other hand, in a world where EU defense spending has to rise by hundreds of billions of euros, how long before we get higher (consumer) taxes and higher EU rates?” (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)

0611 ET – Kuehne + Nagel has been executing on its strategy presented in March 2023, but financial results so far have missed targets and remain below expectations, Vontobel analyst Michael Foeth writes. “We await the presentation of the strategy update with new targets at the upcoming capital markets day on March 25,” he says. Fourth-quarter gross profit rose 7% while EBIT was up 31% compared to the prior year. Nonetheless, EBIT came in 1% below consensus expectations and full-year free cash flow declined 34%, the analyst says. During 2024, Kuehne + Nagel streamlined its organization and set the stage for market-share gains going forward. The shift of the portfolio to improve the profitability mix will continue and the company points to a good start to 2025, Foeth adds. Shares fall 6.4%. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)

0451 ET – Shares of European automakers are falling as U.S. President Trump began imposing tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods as well as on Chinese imports. While major European manufacturers have production plants in the U.S., they rely on an established supply chain that import parts from Canada and Mexico. They also have production plants that build vehicles in Canada and Mexico for export to the U.S. “With Mexico the home of numerous U.S. company manufacturing plants, building around 15% of U.S.-destined cars for brands such as General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, there will be an economic blowback,” says Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors.

For this year, the maker of Aperol aperitifs forecasts moderate growth in organic revenue, with an improving trend expected in the second half of the year, as drink makers continue to face waning demand after a surge in beverage consumption during the pandemic.

The group also anticipates a flat organic earnings before interest and taxes margin in 2025 and said the adjusted EBIT performance is expected to be skewed toward the last six months of the year.

The update comes after Campari appointed Simon Hunt as its new chief executive officer, following the resignation of Matteo Fantacchiotti for personal reasons. Hunt joined the group with more than 30 years’ experience in the premium- and luxury-spirits industry at a challenging time for beverage brands due to trade tensions in key markets.

For 2025, Campari estimates the potential impact of tariffs on imported goods into the U.S. from Mexico and Canada to be around 35 million euros ($36.7 million) starting from March this year and before any mitigation actions, which are currently being assessed.

The potential 12-month impact of 25% duties on imports from Mexico, Canada and Europe into the U.S., which isn’t included in the guidance, is expected between €90 million and €100 million.

The industry is also grappling with a challenging environment in China, another key market for European distillers, after Beijing slapped tariffs on EU cognac imports. The move came after Brussels decided to impose duties on Chinese electric vehicles, the latest tit-for-tat in a trade dispute.

French peer Pernod Ricard lowered its guidance in January, citing deteriorating trends in China and uncertainty about tariffs globally, while U.K. spirits maker Diageo withdrew its midterm targets and warned that U.S. tariffs could weigh down the pace of its recovery.

Despite current woes, Campari expects a gradual return to mid-to-high single-digit organic net sales growth in the medium term and in a normalized macroeconomic environment, before the impact of potential tariffs.

Meanwhile, the company booked sales of €3.07 billion for 2024, up 2.4% organically compared with the prior year. The result came ahead of analysts’ forecasts of €3.04 billion euros, according to a Visible Alpha poll of estimates.

Net profit dropped 39% to €201.6 million due to more moderate sales growth and business investments.

The group noted that 2024 was a challenging year due to macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility as well as poor weather conditions, particularly in Europe.

The company proposed a stable dividend of €0.065 a share."

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has told staff he plans to make the grant program “technology-neutral,” the people said. That change will free up states to award more funds to satellite-internet providers such as Starlink, rather than mainly to companies that lay fiber-optic cables, to connect the millions of U.S. households that lack high-speed internet service.

Republicans have said the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment Program, created by the 2021 infrastructure bill, has moved too slowly and is bogged down by unnecessary rules. Those rules effectively said states could only fund alternative technologies such as satellite in areas where it wasn’t feasible or cost-effective to lay fiber cables.

The potential new rules could drastically increase the share of funding available to Starlink. Under the BEAD program’s original rules, Starlink was expected to get up to $4.1 billion, said people familiar with the matter. With Lutnick’s overhaul, Starlink, a unit of Musk’s SpaceX, could receive $10 billion to $20 billion, they said.

“The Trump administration is committed to slashing government bureaucracy and harnessing cutting-edge technology to deliver real results for the American people, especially rural Americans who were left behind” under the Biden administration, White House spokesman Kush Desai said.

A Starlink representative didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The overhaul could be announced as soon as this week, possibly without some details in place, the people said. Following any changes, states might have to rewrite their plans for how to spend their funding from the program, which could delay the implementation.

Lutnick told staff he plans to do away with other BEAD program rules, including some related to climate impact and sustainability, as well as provisions that encouraged states to fund companies with a racially diverse workforce or union participation, the people said.

The program requires internet-service providers that receive funding to offer affordable plans for lower-income customers. Lutnick has told staff he is considering reducing those obligations, the people said."

Bank stocks slid, with investors concerned about tariffs putting a damper on economic growth. Citigroup shares lost 5.1%. Bank of America stock dropped 4.8%, and Wells Fargo stock dropped 4.2%

Automakers were among the big losers on Monday. The industry relies heavily on a North American supply chain. Stellantis shares dropped 10%; General Motors shares lowered nearly 3%, and American Axle shares dropped 2.7%. “With vehicle prices already elevated and interest rates remaining high, American car buyers could face an even more challenging road,” wrote Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, in a note.

Shares of Ralph Lauren dropped 2.9%. CFO Justin Picicci said this fall that China represented a high single-digit percentage of the brand’s global sourcing.

Smith will take over as CFO in the next month, Starbucks said Tuesday. She has served for about two years as finance chief of Nordstrom, which agreed in December to be taken private. Before joining Nordstrom, she led the finances of Bright Health Group, which now operates under the name NeueHealth, as well as Target. 

Smith succeeds Rachel Ruggeri, who has been Starbucks’ CFO since 2021. Ruggeri briefly served as interim chief executive last year after the company ousted Laxman Narasimhan. Ruggeri has held various senior finance and retail positions—mostly at Starbucks—since she joined the company’s accounting team in 2001.The company didn’t give a reason for Ruggeri’s departure, but said she would assist in the transition. 

The coffee chain is working to stem a string of quarterly sales declines and make the experience of ordering coffee in its stores less hectic and more efficient. In August, the company named Brian Niccol, former chief executive of Chipotle Mexican Grill, as its next CEO. In his first months on the job, Niccol has made a series of changes, including pulling back on discounts. Starbucks said last month it would lay off 1,100 corporate employees in an effort to streamline operations. 

Niccol has also taken smaller steps to smooth the process of getting coffee in its cafes, such as bringing back the self-service condiment bar, a response to customers who complained that pressed baristas weren’t getting their milk and sugar right. 

In January, Starbucks said its U.S. and global same-store sales fell 4% during the quarter ended Dec. 29 from a year earlier, the fourth consecutive decline. Per-share profit, meanwhile, fell 23%. The company said, however, that it was making progress in its recovery efforts.As CFO, Smith will have to make key decisions on investments—for instance, in the company’s stores, ingredients and customer experience—that can ultimately result in stronger sales, said Dan Su, an equity analyst at Morningstar, the investment research company. 

The CFO transition at Starbucks is the latest executive shift at the company. Niccol, who had been Taco Bell’s CEO before joining Chipotle, in January brought over two of its former executives, Mike Grams and Meredith Sandland, to serve as North America chief stores officer and chief store development officer, respectively. North America President Sara Trilling, whose job encompassed both those roles, left Starbucks after more than 20 years with the company.

Starbucks said Smith, 61 years old, will receive a $5 million cash signing bonus and a replacement equity grant with a target value of $6.4 million to help make up for roughly $15 million in cash incentive and equity awards she is leaving behind at Nordstrom.

Smith will also receive an initial base salary of $925,000 and an annual bonus with a target of 125% of her base pay, the company said, along with a fiscal 2025 annual equity award with a target value of $4.5 million.

Ruggeri will receive severance benefits associated with a separation without cause, Starbucks said in a regulatory filing. 

Nordstrom said it has launched a search for a new finance chief. Both Starbucks and Nordstrom are based in Seattle."

The biggest tech company by market value is also the most directly exposed to cross-border tariffs—particularly with China. Hardware products account for three-quarters of Apple’s annual revenue, and most of those products are manufactured in China. BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan estimated last month that 10% tariffs on Chinese imports could knock 2%-3% off Apple’s projected per-share earnings in 2026.

Apple shares have largely shrugged off the worries. The stock slipped less than 1% by Tuesday's closing bell, but it is the only megacap tech to have notched gains over the last month. It is also the only one still sporting a market cap above $3 trillion. That has kept Apple’s valuation multiple around 32 times projected earnings for this year—18% above its five-year average, according to FactSet data.

Why are Apple’s shareholders so sanguine? The company itself has given no details about the expected impacts of tariffs. Chief Executive Tim Cook punted on the topic during Apple’s earnings call in January.

Investors may hope the matter resolves itself sooner than later. Best Buy said Tuesday its fiscal-year forecast doesn't account for tariffs, with Chief Executive Corie Barry citing ""uncertainty about the duration, timing, amount and countries involved,"" among other factors. Nonetheless, the consumer-electronics retailer expects a one-percentage point hit to its same-store sales if 10% tariffs on Chinese goods last a full year.

Barry also admitted to being in uncharted waters; “We've never seen this kind of breadth of tariffs,” Barry said. Apple may be sailing into rougher seas than it has acknowledged."

The S&P 500 index dropped by as much as 2% early in the trading day on Tuesday, following the official start overnight of 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.

A midday snap-back rally fizzled by the close. Stocks were actually up for a period in the late afternoon, but tumbled again in the closing minutes. For the day, the S&P 500 was off 1.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite ended down 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 670 points.

Investors started betting on the Federal Reserve riding to the rescue. Interest-rate futures on Tuesday priced in a stronger likelihood of a May rate cut.

Some market moves suggested investors think the tariffs may be short-lived. The U.S. dollar's gains versus the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso were surprisingly muted. And longer-term 10-year Treasury yields edged higher to 4.209%. Both imply a possible view that the ultimate duration, and economic impact, of the tariffs may be limited.

President Trump, however, did not appear in any mood to back down. Canada's prime minister gave a fiery speech promising retaliatory measures. President Trump said in a social-media post that he would add additional tariffs in response to such moves.

Best Buy was the S&P 500's worst performer. The electronics retailer warned that its vendors would pass along tariffs' costs, and that ""U.S. consumers are likely to face higher prices."" Its shares were down more than 13%.

Walgreens Boots Alliance was boosted by news of a potential buyout. In an exclusive report, the Journal said that the drugstore chain was closing in on a deal to be acquired by a private-equity firm. Walgreens' shares jumped more than 5%."
2025-03-04 21:56:00+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/financial-services-roundup-market-talk-04adc6d5,"1455 ET – The effect of U.S. tariffs is likely to be felt across a spectrum of industries in North America and hit households, the CEO of Allianz Trade in Canada says. David Dienesch tells The WSJ materials Canadians and Americans use in the building sector, including lumber and steel products, will be directly affected. He expects the food industry, which generally has a shorter-cycle supply chain, also will be impacted immediately. And the auto industry looks to be a direct target of the tariffs launched by President Trump, as well potentially cumulative tariffs. “The result of this will be inflationary effects at the grocery aisle on both sides of the border. Higher housing costs, including renovation costs, and higher costs for the purchase of both new and used vehicles are all to be expected.” (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)

1450 ET – Canadian businesses may be hesitant to look to alternative markets as demand falters in the U.S. under the weight of tariffs, but they can compete in markets around the world, the head of Allianz Trade’s operations in Canada says. David Dienesch tells The WSJ that Canadian firms have competed successfully in the U.S. marketplace. “We can compete elsewhere, too.” Dienesch said Canadians have access to over 50 countries via free trade agreements in Europe and Asia, and the country has abundant natural resources, one of the world’s biggest economies and a solid industrial base. The first step would be to reach out to industry export associations and financial associations. They also should look locally for alternative supply-chain inputs, and seek ways to limit to foreign exchange risk. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)

1432 ET – Front-month gold futures rose while other markets were pressured by the implementation of tariffs by the Trump administration. Fear over stagflation in the U.S. economy is also helping out gold, with recent economic data causing a pivot toward recession fears. “There is growing speculation that we may be witnessing the beginning of the end of U.S. exceptionalism,” says Ole Hansen of Saxo Bank, with money going to safe havens like gold and investments outside of the U.S. Front-month gold settles up 0.7% to $2,909.60 a troy ounce. SPDR Gold shares are up 0.7%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)

1341 ET – Growth in the Islamic finance industry in Central Asia could be led by Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, supported by government initiatives to tap funding from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Fitch Ratings says. “There are some signs of the ties with the GCC being deepened, which could help Islamic finance penetration,” according to Fitch. Although still small, and likely to remain niche, growth in the sector has been seen, Fitch says. Kyrgyzstan has just one fully-fledged Islamic bank and four Islamic windows, but Islamic financing increased by 49.3% last year, above the total banking sector credit growth of 32.2%, according to Fitch. Also, the Kazakh government set a target for the Islamic finance industry’s market share to reach 3% to 5% by the end of this year, according to Fitch. (stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com)

1325 ET – The tariffs launched by President Trump and being levied back by Canada will disproportionately affect the less fortunate economically, Royal Bank of Canada CEO Dave McKay says. Speaking at a conference in Toronto, the head of one of the largest banks in the world by market cap says he hopes the tariffs are short lived and everyone can get back to a growth agenda on both sides of the border. McKay says he says companies can adjust if tariffs endure, finding new markets tariffs if existing market stop buying, and exchange rates will adjust to absorb some of the impact. But consumers will have to absorb the cost and some industries, such as the auto sector, will feel enormous pain, he adds. “Those tariffs impact the part of the economy that are struggling the most in Canada and in the U.S.” (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)

1319 ET – The consumer is being more mindful about spending since President Trump took office, according to Target CEO Brian Cornell. Target’s sales in February fell year-over-year reflecting persistent economic uncertainty that’s made consumers cautious, particularly in discretionary categories, Cornell says on a call with analysts. Target also says the tariffs are creating uncertainty. As a result, the retailer will be maintaining a larger-than-normal cushion on the balance sheet, and will no longer provide quarterly guidance, CFO Jim Lee says. “This change reflects our expectation of continued elevated volatility, which limits the effectiveness of quarterly forecasts,” Lee says, noting that sales have become more volatile since the recent holiday season. Target falls 3.7%. (sabela.ojea@wsj.com; @sabelaojeaguix)

0333 ET – The U.S. equities market could see further volatility until Washington pauses its trade war with the rest of the world, OCBC analysts write in a note. Overnight, Trump signed an order to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico as well as an additional 10% on those from China. This led to a sell-off on Wall Street, with the S&P down 1.76% while 10-year treasury yields fell to 4.13% from 4.20%. The Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut interest rates this year if tariffs boost inflation, they add. OCBC expects U.S. GDP growth to slow from a strong 2.8% last year to a solid 2.2% this year, while China’s growth is anticipated to drop to 4.2% from 5.0%. OCBC forecasts U.S. tariffs of 20% imposed for a full year may shave up to 1 percentage point from China’s GDP growth. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy_jiahuihuang)

0317 ET – China’s banking sector should see higher cost efficiency over the long run with the use of artificial intelligence, DBS analysts write in a note. Chinese bank stocks have recently underperformed the market due to sector rotation following the emergence of DeepSeek, DBS says. However, China banks are worth looking at in the medium term as economic uncertainty is expected to persist under the base-case scenario, DBS says. In the long term, lenders should could benefit from AI-driven cost savings in risk control and customer service, DBS says. Among Chinese banks, DBS’s top picks are China Construction Bank and China Merchants Bank as they are likely to benefit more from fintech and AI applications.

0316 ET – The profitability of Singapore banks are likely to remain broadly stable this year, Moody’s Ratings analysts say in a note. Strong 2024 results position them well against macroeconomic and market challenges that may arise this year, they say, noting U.S. tariffs and sector-specific exposures like commercial real estate. The decline in net interest margin seen among the banks will likely be modest due to fewer rate cuts the analysts say, adding that the drop will likely be offset by mid- to high- single-digit loan growth. In addition, a robust fee income from wealth management as well as card and loan-related fees may also support non-interest income growth, they add.(amanda.lee@wsj.com)

0231 ET – Srisawad Corp.’s balance-sheet constraints are likely easing, Thanachart Securities’ Sarachada Sornsong says in a research report as the brokerage maintains the stock’s buy rating. Its debenture-market situation is improving, with the company and subsidiary Srisawad Capital 1969 having successfully issued 3 billion baht and 1 billion baht of debentures in November 2024 and January 2025, respectively. The Thai company’s clean-up of its nonperforming loans has been mostly completed, substantially improving its financial position. However, the brokerage cuts its earnings forecasts for Srisawad by average of 3.3% over 2026-2028 to reflect more conservative loan-growth assumptions. It lowers the stock’s target price to THB44.00 from THB47.00. Shares are unchanged at THB34.25. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)

2347 ET – Malaysia’s central bank is expected to keep its benchmark overnight policy rate steady at 3.00% in March, according to seven economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. Bank Negara may stand pat in its March meeting, as its current stance supports economic growth amid stable inflation, DBS economists Taimur Baig and Ma Tieying say in a note. However, rising external risks, such as U.S.-led trade protectionism and potential inflationary pressures from domestic policy changes, including the RON95 subsidy reforms in mid-2025, could complicate future rate decisions, they say. With regional central banks turning dovish to sustain growth, Malaysia is likely to face increasing pressure to ease policy, especially if U.S. tariffs on key exports–such as semiconductors–significantly impact the growth outlook, they add. The rate decision is due Thursday."

The Yum Brands division Tuesday said it aims for more than 3,000 international Taco Bell stores by 2030, up from a total of 1,150 last year. It also aims for domestic stores to average $3 million in sales per location in five years, up from $2.2 million.

Taco Bell Chief Executive Sean Tresvant said in an interview following an investor event that Yum Brands’ global supply chain would help his division navigate any possible fallout from the tariffs imposed on imports. The chain will continue to stress its value to consumers sensitive about rising prices for other purchases.

Asked if any sullying in perceptions of America abroad could impact its growth hopes, Tresvant said Taco Bell has taken off in the U.K., Spain, India and Australia, and believes that global demand for his brand will continue.

“If you have the right brand and are in the right markets, you can be successful,” he said.

Some of Michael Farr’s have gone so far as to threaten leaving the country.

Farr, the chief executive of D.C.-based investment firm Farr, Miller & Washington, said he’s heard from particularly worried Democratic clients who are “very concerned and very upset—both with international and domestic policies.” Those clients are considering selling investments, he said.

His Republican clients are more satisfied with Trump’s policies, but have still raised an eyebrow at the pace of change. “They think it’s a whole lot very quickly,” Farr said.

Farr wants his clients to exercise caution, with the understanding that a stock-market correction was expected and that strong long-term investment strategies will still yield strong results.

“Long-term investors endure all sorts of tumultuous times, and long-term investors will endure this one,” he said. “The last thing Warren Buffet’s doing is running out and selling…cool heads and a dispassionate, disciplined approach is the best advice we can give.”

Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, has been warning clients about the potential impacts of tariffs for months. Still, some of them were “a little bit nervous” as the deadline drew closer.

“Everyone’s hoping it's a short term situation, but it’s always hard to know,” Zaccarelli said. “That’s the risk with trade wars and tariffs: sometimes they can take on a life of their own.”"
2025-03-04 23:42:00+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/articles/rba-deputy-gov-hauser-says-inflation-war-not-over-trade-uncertainty-rising-b2205846,"SYDNEY–It’s too soon to declare that the battle to contain inflation in Australia is over and a cautious approach to interest rate cuts is still needed, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Andrew Hauser, said Wednesday.

“Interest rates will go where they need to go to maximize the chances of keeping inflation sustainably in the target band while helping to sustain full employment. Progress towards that target has been good — but it is too soon to declare victory,” Hauser told the AFR Business Summit on Wednesday.

The comments come after the RBA cut the official cash rate for the first time since 2020 in February, making it clear then that a string of cuts was unlikely to follow over coming months given ongoing inflation risks and the tightness of the labor market.

Hauser also focused on the worsening outlook for world trade as the U.S. has moved to impose significant tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with reprisals following quickly.

“Confidence has taken a bit of a knock in recent days. Some of that reflects recent U.S. data, and some evolution in the direction of tariff policy,” he said.

There is a risk that the uncertainty may prompt consumers and businesses to “batten down the hatches, postponing planned spending, particularly on longer-term capital investment, until things become clearer.

“Such watchful waiting could prove rational individually, but economically damaging in aggregate,” he added.

Hauser said the RBA’s cut in the official cash rate last month to 4.10% from 4.35% was done to avoid the inflation undershooting the midpoint of the 2% to 3% inflation target band.

“We set monetary policy such that inflation is expected to return to the midpoint of the target range. And we do that because it maximizes the chances of inflation remaining sustainably in that range,” he said.

“The rate cut in February reduces the risks of inflation undershooting that midpoint, but the board does not currently share the market’s confidence that a sequence of further cuts will be required,” Hauser added.

“The board will continue to take decisions, meeting by meeting, in the interests of all Australians,” he said.

Hauser confirmed that the decision to lower the OCR in February was a closely contested one.

“There were good arguments for both a hold and a cut — and the board discussed them in some detail … Foremost in that debate included the outlook for global activity, and the degree of spare capacity in the labor market,” he added."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the changes in the global economy and trade could be an opportunity for Indian firms to invest more and take advantage of the world’s need for alternative supply chain hubs.

“We have seen that when supply chains are disrupted, it affects the global economy,” Modi told business leaders during an online session on Tuesday. “The world needs a trusted partner which produces high-quality products and the supply is reliable.”

The prime minister asked manufacturers and exporters to “take big steps” to not only benefit from the changing global order but also the various reforms his government has introduced since he came to power.

“This reform consistency will continue in the coming years and I urge you to move ahead with full confidence,” he said. “This is a big opportunity for us. I want our industry not to look at global expectations as mere spectators.”


Modi’s comments come at a time when India is in the midst of negotiating deals with major trading partners. The world’s fastest-growing major economy aims to conclude a trade pact with the US by fall this year, in an effort to shield itself from Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. Both the UK and the EU are also in talks to sign a free trade agreement with the South Asian nation.

“India continues to be a growth engine for the global economy,” Modi said, adding that several nations want “to establish an economic partnership” with it."
2025-03-04T09:08:58Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/622405/nothing-phone-3a-pro-essential-space-price-specs,"The Nothing 3A phones were just announced with a new take on the company’s “make tech more fun again” ethos. These devices have improved hardware over the Phone 2A, updated cameras, and a new feature called the Essential Space to store and index your miscellaneous screenshots, voice memos, and photographs, all through a dedicated button. Starting at $379 for the 3A and $459 for the 3A Pro, they offer solid specs for their midrange prices — and a look at what Nothing has been working on for this AI-centric moment.
The 3A and 3A Pro are mainly differentiated by their cameras, which you’ll notice just by glancing at the two devices. The 3A Pro’s prominent round camera housing includes a 3x periscope telephoto lens; the 3A offers a standard 2x zoom. Both phones include a 50-megapixel f/1.8 main camera and an 8-megapixel ultrawide. The telephoto cameras on each use a 50-megapixel sensor for lossless crop zoom: 4x for the 3A and 6x for the 3A Pro.

It’s not a small camera bump on the 3A Pro.
They’re big phones, each with a 6.77-inch display, and the 3A Pro feels especially chunky with the protruding camera housing. Both use Nothing’s striking translucent back panel design for a bold look, which balances an awkward camera bump on the 3A Pro. When I started using the phone I felt like my fingers were constantly bumping against the housing. I’ve adjusted to it after a few days and dig its Pop Socket-esque functionality.

The video player is currently playing an ad. You can skip the ad in 5 sec with a mouse or keyboard
The phones come with Snapdragon 7S Gen 3 chipsets, 12 GB of RAM, and 256 GB of storage, which is generous for the midrange class. They ship with Android 15 and Nothing is promising three years of OS updates and six years of security patches — a decent, if not the best, software policy for a budget phone. They’re being offered in the US through Nothing’s beta program.

The Glyph interface and LED light strips are still present, but Nothing seems to be shifting its efforts toward software features. The Essential Space is a new place to save screenshots, voice memos, and images, like Google’s Pixel Screenshots app. It answers the eternal question: what do I do with this thing?
Is your photo gallery cluttered with pictures of stuff you want to remember? Do you wish you had somewhere to keep all those inspiration photos for your bathroom makeover? Do you yearn for a place to put the information in an email you keep searching your inbox for every time you need it? Then you get what the Essential Space is all about. You save stuff there, it uses AI to pull out relevant bits of information, and it helps organize what would otherwise be left floating around your phone somewhere.
		
1/2You can add individual items with a note; the phone will use this along with data pulled from the image with AI to suggest action items.
Using the Essential Key to add things to the Essential Space took a little adjustment. It’s right where I’m used to the power button sitting, so I kept pressing it unintentionally. A single press will capture a screenshot, and a double tap opens the app so you can browse through your collections. This feels backwards for reasons I can’t quite explain, but I’ve mostly gotten used to it.
Nitpicking aside, I think Nothing is onto something. I added screenshots of travel information for an upcoming flight that are otherwise spread across emails and apps. The Essential Space keeps it in one tidy spot and is good at pulling key timing and dates from the screengrabs. It’ll even make a little to-do list for you. It didn’t quite get everything right about my connecting flight, but I think that’s because the date wasn’t visible in both screenshots. The software seems to do a decent job when it has complete information to work with.

The Essential Key is a good button in the wrong spot.
The functionality is pretty simple right now. Nothing has more on the roadmap like a mode that starts recording a voice memo when you flip the phone over, and the ability to automatically organize related content into collections. It seems like a useful feature with a smart AI layer, rather than something that leans into AI just for kicks.
The 3A is available to order March 4th and ships March 11th. The 3A Pro goes up for order March 11th, and will ship starting March 25th.

2025-03-04T13:08:16Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/623574/samsung-display-concept-foldable-gaming-handheld-briefcase-mwc-2025,"For a phone show, there’s an awful lot of cool non-phone stuff at Mobile World Congress this year. Take Lenovo’s ThinkBook Flip concept, which answers the question: “What if your laptop unfolded, and then unfolded again?” Samsung’s Display group has been apparently thinking along the same lines, because it has some interesting new folding concepts at MWC including a briefcase screen and a foldable gaming handheld, which I want, like, yesterday.
Samsung Display is, of course, a display manufacturer, so these concepts are just that. They’re demonstrations of what its screens could maybe, possibly do in the hands of another manufacturer. But they’re still cool as hell, and they were very popular with MWC attendees who had to constantly be told to stop trying to touch them. That was especially true of this Switch-style portable gaming handheld mockup, which opens fully flat and folds in half for storage when you’re done playing.

I don’t know if it’s the fun colors or the portability aspect, but it’s super compelling and just begs to be picked up. This, again, is not allowed, but I found someone to fold it and unfold it for me.

A PR rep was allowed to handle the gaming handheld, but nobody at the booth was authorized to touch the screen briefcase. So all I could do was look at it from a distance and admire its resemblance to the LG briefcase TV. Except, you know, with a folding screen. It’s not clear exactly how you’d use the thing — do you prop it up on its side? Maybe the briefcase would have a kickstand of some kind? Unclear. Still cool, though.

The other attention-grabbing concept on the booth was this asymmetrical Z Flip-style phone I’ve affectionately named The Claw. When it’s fully open it looks basically like a normal slab screen, but it closes with two hinges to leave part of the inner screen visible. It’s neat, but seems completely impractical and I’d be way too nervous about debris getting to the inner screen since it’s not totally protected. I do like the two-tone finish, though.


Samsung had an assortment of other examples and concepts on the booth, some of which we’d just seen at CES. If you can imagine a screen that stretches, bends, or flexes in some way, then Samsung Display probably has one. And you know what? I love them for that.

2025-03-04T13:17:53Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/623403/trump-imposes-tariffs-mexico-canada-china,"President Donald Trump has followed through on his temporarily delayed tariff threats. The US will impose a 25 percent tariff on goods imported from Mexico and Canada, while China will face an additional 10 percent tariff on top of the 10 percent tax previously enacted.

On Monday, Trump dashed hopes that a deal could be made to prevent the US from imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada. “No room left for Mexico or for Canada,” Trump said during a press conference. “They’re all set. They go into effect tomorrow.”

Trump initially announced the tariffs in February, saying they would “hold China, Mexico, and Canada accountable for their promises to halt the flood of poisonous drugs into the United States.” However, he gave both Canada and Mexico a one-month extension to reach a potential agreement with the US – but that never happened.


RelatedTrump’s first round of tariffs is almost here
The tariffs are expected to raise the prices of a range of products in the US, including food, clothing, fuel, lithium batteries, and more. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the country will retaliate with tariffs of its own, and Mexico has hinted at doing the same.

China announced on Tuesday that it’s putting a 15 percent tariff on imports of US agricultural products, including chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton. It also added 15 US companies, including drone maker Skydio, to its export control list.

This isn’t the end of Trump’s tariffs plan, either. He also wants to put a tax on imported chips, cars, and farming equipment as early as April. It’s not clear how long this latest round of tariffs will last, however, as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business that he thinks Trump is “going to work something out with them.”"
2025-03-04T13:59:23Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/623428/dell-alienware-oled-monitor-aw2725d-price-release-date,"2024 was the year OLED cemented its victory — and 2025 might let more gamers actually afford the glorious screens. Today, Alienware says it will try* to bring the price of a QD-OLED gaming panel down to $549 this summer with the AW2725D, a new 27-inch 2560 x 1440 QHD monitor that’ll offer OLED’s incredible blacks and deep colors.

Outwardly, the AW2725D looks and sounds almost identical to the $899 27-inch AW2725Q 4K 240Hz QD-OLED monitor that Alienware is just now putting on sale today — but $350 cheaper, if you can settle for 110 pixels per inch (ppi), rather than the class-leading 166ppi that Alienware’s 4K OLED screen will offer.

There could be other compromises, too, as Alienware didn’t have spec sheets available by press time… but it’s actually a slightly faster panel at 280Hz versus 240Hz, offers the same 99 percent DCI-P3 color coverage, Delta E<2 color accuracy, and the same small rounded rectangle of an adjustable height stand (see below). Alienware display product manager James Cha tells us it also has the same graphite film heatsink and not-too-aggressive burn-in protection algorithm I’ve been enjoying in the $1,199 32-inch version of the screen.

If that $549 panel wasn’t enough to tempt you away from the $899 version, what about a curved 34-inch ultrawide for $799? That’s what Dell is targeting* for the AW3425DW you see above, its latest version of the first 3440 x 1440 QD-OLED monitor it wowed us with in 2022.

There, you’re getting a 240Hz panel (up from 165Hz), HDMI 2.1 fixed rate link instead of TMDS signaling (which should provide enough bandwidth to go above 4K60 HDR over HDMI), a USB-C port with 15W charging, and a new user interface for its onscreen display, all for $100 less* than before.

Alienware’s also still offering its same three-year burn-in warranty on its QD-OLED panels, where it’ll ship you a new monitor before you have to return the old one. When I asked whether Dell might further extend its warranty now that panel maker Samsung Display offers more protections, Cha says, “That’s something we could look into.”

The ultrawide’s ports; here’s hoping the USB-C port isn’t that very dark, very recessed one.
The ultrawide’s ports; here’s hoping the USB-C port isn’t that very dark, very recessed one. Image: Dell
Alienware has more new monitors where these came from, including a pair of budget 25-inch and 27-inch Fast IPS screens that start at $249* and $269,* respectively, each using the same new industrial design as the QD-OLED screens. (The 25-inch AW2525HM is a 1080p 320Hz panel coming in the summer; the 27-inch AW2725DM is a 1440p 180Hz screen arriving in two days.)

It’s unlikely that Dell has an exclusive on the Samsung panels inside these new monitors, so don’t be surprised if other 27-inch and 34-inch QD-OLED screens hit the market at new low prices, too. In fact, Samsung Electronics recently reduced the price of its 27-inch Odyssey G61SD (1440p 240Hz QD-OLED) to $549 in an extended sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and its own store, perhaps in anticipation of successors.

*We’ve used asterisks to indicate that Dell apparently can’t promise exact prices for these quite yet, with all of them subject to change — possibly due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs on China that are set to go into effect today."
2025-03-05 01:37:00+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/articles/rbnz-gov-orr-resigns-with-inflation-tamed-but-with-fresh-threats-on-horizon-00d0b3fe,"SYDNEY–The Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Adrian Orr, announced his resignation Wednesday, ending a volatile seven-year term as the head of the central bank marked by the policy response to the Covid-19 pandemic and a global surge in inflation that quickly followed it.

Finance Minister Nicola Willis acknowledged the resignation, saying in a statement that she “wished him well for the future.”

Orr’s exit comes as inflation has been tamed and the economy forecast to grow faster in the year ahead, bringing unemployment down and ending years of recession due to high interest rates.

The RBNZ was heavy handed when responding to rising inflation in the postpandemic environment, keeping the reins of policy tight until the middle of last year when it became clear that inflation was in retreat.

Since then, the RBNZ has slashed the official cash rate by 175 basis points, with more expected over coming months, albeit at a reduced pace.

Still, it’s a difficult moment for Orr to depart given rising uncertainties globally in the shape of a widening trade war led by the U.S.

Still, in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, the central bank’s deputy governor Christian Hawkesby highlighted that with inflation under control, the country was now in a much better position to confront global threats.

Hawkesby will be acting governor until March 31 and from April 1 the government will appoint a temporary Governor for a period of up to six months."
2025-03-05 02:00:00+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/taxes/self-employement-taxes-guide-c9bec6a6,"SYDNEY–It’s too soon to declare that the battle to contain inflation in Australia is over and a cautious approach to interest rate cuts is still needed, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Andrew Hauser, said Wednesday.

“Interest rates will go where they need to go to maximize the chances of keeping inflation sustainably in the target band while helping to sustain full employment. Progress towards that target has been good — but it is too soon to declare victory,” Hauser told the AFR Business Summit on Wednesday.

The comments come after the RBA cut the official cash rate for the first time since 2020 in February, making it clear then that a string of cuts was unlikely to follow over coming months given ongoing inflation risks and the tightness of the labor market.

Hauser also focused on the worsening outlook for world trade as the U.S. has moved to impose significant tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with reprisals following quickly.

“Confidence has taken a bit of a knock in recent days. Some of that reflects recent U.S. data, and some evolution in the direction of tariff policy,” he said.

There is a risk that the uncertainty may prompt consumers and businesses to “batten down the hatches, postponing planned spending, particularly on longer-term capital investment, until things become clearer.

“Such watchful waiting could prove rational individually, but economically damaging in aggregate,” he added.

Hauser said the RBA’s cut in the official cash rate last month to 4.10% from 4.35% was done to avoid the inflation undershooting the midpoint of the 2% to 3% inflation target band.

“We set monetary policy such that inflation is expected to return to the midpoint of the target range. And we do that because it maximizes the chances of inflation remaining sustainably in that range,” he said.

“The rate cut in February reduces the risks of inflation undershooting that midpoint, but the board does not currently share the market’s confidence that a sequence of further cuts will be required,” Hauser added.

“The board will continue to take decisions, meeting by meeting, in the interests of all Australians,” he said.

Hauser confirmed that the decision to lower the OCR in February was a closely contested one.

“There were good arguments for both a hold and a cut — and the board discussed them in some detail … Foremost in that debate included the outlook for global activity, and the degree of spare capacity in the labor market,” he added."
2025-03-05 02:02:00+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/economy/australias-economy-gathers-momentum-as-fresh-storms-brew-4b0069c0,"SYDNEY–Australia’s economy grew at a faster pace in the fourth quarter of 2024, shrugging off the threat of a recession just as the global outlook has dimmed amid a rapidly escalating trade war led by the U.S., and a sharp rise in geopolitical risks.

The economy grew 0.6% sequentially in the December quarter, and by 1.3% from a year earlier, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday. The economy had clocked an annual growth rate of 0.8% in the prior quarter.

While the economic growth remains well below its historical average pace, it is pulling clear of a slump that saw growth virtually flat-line over the last year. Meanwhile, fresh storms are brewing as the U.S. moves to drive up tariffs on its key trading partners and stoke global uncertainty by halting aid for Ukraine in its war against Russia.

The Reserve Bank of Australia has said it is watching the situation closely, especially in terms of how it affects China, the country’s largest trading partner. However, the RBA’s trajectory for interest rates remains unclear as the central bank is uncertain about how crippled global supply chains and rapidly rising tariffs will affect inflation.

Coupled with the probability of weakened global growth, the central bank remains cautious.

RBA Deputy Gov. Andrew Hauser told a conference earlier Wednesday that even as the global backdrop weakens, the policy-making board of the RBA doesn’t yet see a need for a series of interest rate cuts, adding to the one announced in February.

“Interest rates will go where they need to go to maximize the chances of keeping inflation sustainably in the target band while helping to sustain full employment. Progress towards that target has been good — but it is too soon to declare victory,” Hauser told the AFR Business Summit.

Both public and private spending contributed to the modest recovery in growth in the fourth quarter, supported by a rise in exports of goods and services, the ABS said.

GDP per capita grew 0.1% this quarter following seven consecutive quarters of falls, it added.

Household spending rose 0.4% after a flat result in the September quarter with spending on essentials such as rent and health among the highest contributors to spending growth, the data showed.

Household discretionary spending rose as people made the most of retail sales events and increased spending on hospitality, the ABS said.

Growth in government spending moderated to 0.7% per cent in the quarter following larger rises in previous quarters, the data showed.

Private investment rose 0.3% in the quarter with a focus of new engineering, construction of electricity generation and distribution projects, and mining.

Public investment rose 1.8% amid a boom in state and territory government spending on public transport, roads, water and renewable electricity infrastructure, the ABS said.

By Wednesday morning, that sales process was suddenly in limbo.

In an extraordinary reversal, the General Services Administration removed from its website about 440 federal buildings representing nearly 80 million square feet of space that only hours earlier it had listed for sale.

That followed stinging criticism from workers in the buildings, elected officials and others opposed to the mass property sale that led the GSA to pause.

A spokesman for the GSA, which manages federal real estate, said a list of specific properties for sale will be republished in the near future “after we evaluate this initial input and determine how we can make it easier for stakeholders to understand the nuances of the assets listed.”

The Trump administration has been aiming to sell scores of federal buildings throughout the country as part of President Trump’s effort to shrink the government and slash federal spending.While many of the properties are aging, shabby buildings that wouldn’t fetch much, some better-known properties were also up for sale. The list that the GSA made public on Tuesday included the Washington, D.C., headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Labor Department.

But later Tuesday, the GSA reduced the list to 330 properties and removed many of the higher-profile buildings. On Wednesday morning, the GSA website no longer listed any properties. It said that the list of “non-core properties for disposal” was “coming soon.”

The shift by the federal agency represented a rare setback for the government overhaul efforts by the Trump administration, which has moved swiftly through the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency to shed costs by urging federal workers to take buyouts and firing thousands of newly hired workers.

At a House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, lawmakers discussed slowing the process down. Rep. Rick Larsen (D., Wash.) blasted the GSA plan to sell so many buildings when agencies are shrinking their workforce.

“It’s flummoxing to me why there’s this headlong rush from the GSA to do these things that they’re having to pull back on anyway,” he said.

Even a member of the GOP pushed back at the hearing. Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R., Pa.) said he knew nothing of the cuts, which would affect multiple buildings in his district, until the press release came out yesterday.Whenever it resumes, the government’s sales process could still hit cities in dozens of states. It will likely put new pressure on office-building values during one of the worst downturns for the industry since World War II.

The federal government for years has been aware that dozens of its properties are underused and badly in need of upgrade. The GSA was taking steps to dispose of many properties when President Trump started his second term.

But the Trump administration is poised to accelerate the plan to sell properties as well as terminate millions of square feet of federal leases on space in private buildings. Musk’s DOGE has included more than 740 leases on the list of cutbacks it has targeted as part of its money-saving efforts, up from around 100 leases just a week ago.A couple of DOGE staffers have been working with consultants to determine which buildings to dispose of and how best to do it, said Darrell Crate, chief executive of Easterly Government Properties, a real-estate investment trust that leases office space to the federal government.

“They are identifying buildings with significant deferred maintenance and trying to figure out what those buildings would be worth to a private buyer,” he said.The initial list of 440 properties primarily targeted the more than 150 buildings in the Washington, D.C., area, where the office market has experienced one of the highest increases in vacancy and lowest return-to-office rates in the U.S. The list also included numerous offices, labs and other properties in dozens of other states that are used by a range of agencies.

Some commercial property investors are already eyeing federal buildings that are on the block or privately owned buildings where the government has plans to cancel leases.

Real-estate developer Don Peebles and his partners in the firm Donahue Douglas have launched a fund that focuses on office conversions. Washington, D.C., is one of the main target markets.

“This is just the beginning,” Peebles said.

U.S. office vacancy rates have soared and values have plummeted in recent years because of high interest rates and the increase in remote work during the pandemic. The hardest hit buildings are those that have high vacancies and are badly in need of upgrades, problems facing many of the properties that the GSA is targeting for sale.

The average age of GSA-owned buildings is more than 50 years old, and most of those buildings have never been renovated, said Dan Mathews, a member of the Public Buildings Reform Board, an independent agency set up in 2016 to make property-disposal recommendations to the GSA.

“They are pretty cheap buildings thrown up quickly without the best building materials,” he said of buildings that are at least a half-century old. “In many respects they’re functionally obsolete. They need a massive amount of capital to renovate those buildings.”"

1114 ET – Oil futures move deeper into the red after the EIA reports a bigger-than-expected 3.6 million barrel increase in U.S. crude inventories, which adds to bearish implications of OPEC+ returning withheld barrels starting next month and possible economic fallout from U.S. tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China. The OPEC+ plan to unwind cuts is still flexible, notes Alex Hodes of StoneX. The group “has routinely tested the waters by publishing a bold change in policy and then walking back those comments or watering down the implementation,” he writes, adding that “this could be another one of those sell the rumor, buy the fact situations.” WTI is off 3.8% at $65.66 a barrel and Brent falls 3.2% to $68.73 a barrel.

The oil-and-gas giant’s performance-linked dividend will fall to less than $1 billion in 2025, down from $43 billion in 2024, and result in total dividends falling 31% year-on-year, they write. Capital expenditure is set to increase in 2025 but should plateau in 2026 before declining, they write. In the long-run, the company offers attractive returns but its share price is constrained by the limited upside to oil prices, a more expensive valuation comparative to peers and lower shareholder distributions, they write.

0912 ET – Oil futures are lower for a fourth consecutive session, weighed down by prospects of higher OPEC+ output starting next month and uncertainty over the eventual impact of the U.S. import tariffs. “OPEC adding barrels had made the supply and demand worse and the potential upside risks for oil are dropping with OPEC now no longer a risk,” TP ICAP’s Scott Shelton says in a note. He adds that serious negotiations on the Russia-Ukraine war are looking more and more likely. “I feel like any rally in WTI above $70 however will be sold in the front,” he says.

0311 ET – The operating outlook for PTT Global Chemical in 2025 seems weak, Maybank Securities (Thailand)’s Chak Reungsinpinya says in a research report. Its petrochemical spreads are likely to be weaker, driven by oversupply and flattish demand growth, the analyst says. Also, many of the Thai company’s business units will likely undergo major maintenance shutdowns throughout the year, which could keep earnings at very low levels. Moreover, a major concerns is for more impairment charges incoming after the chemical company booked over THB20 billion in impairment last year. The brokerage lowers the stock’s target price to THB16.00 from THB23.00 with an unchanged hold rating. Shares are 7.05% higher at THB16.70. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)

An earnings boost from its unit’s acquisition of a 60% stake in Chromite Gas is expected following the deal’s financial close in January, the analyst says. The electric power distributor should also sustain solid distribution-utility sales growth this year given currently hotter temperatures in the Philippines, the analyst says. The brokerage raises the stock’s target price to PHP570.00 from PHP524.00, partly due to higher contribution from Chromite Gas as guided by management. Shares are 0.9% lower at PHP495.60.

That means Friday's edition of the monthly jobs report, always a major data point, could attract greater scrutiny than usual. Appearances from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and several of his colleagues, in their last public remarks before the Fed's next rate decision, will also be closely watched.

On the corporate front, results are still due this week from retailers and semiconductor companies, two sectors that are both vulnerable to trade tensions. Investors will be on alert for updates about tariffs and export controls.

Here's a rundown of what to watch:

Today

Data: Services PMIs from S&P and ISM are due at 9:45 a.m. ET and 10 a.m., respectively. In late February, preliminary readings of S&P purchasing managers indexes showed services activity at a 25-month low. And manufacturing PMIs, released Monday, pointed to tariff-related disruptions.

The Fed's Beige Book, which compiles economic anecdotes from around the U.S., follows at 2 p.m.

Earnings: Campbell’s and Abercrombie & Fitch are due before the bell; Marvell Technology reports after the close.

Tomorrow

Data: Reports on U.S. productivity for the fourth quarter and the January trade deficit are both due at 8:30 a.m.

Earnings: Expect Macy’s and Kroger before the bell; Broadcom, Costco, Gap and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are due in the evening.

Speakers: Fed governor Christopher Waller will discuss the economic outlook with correspondent Nick Timiraos at The Wall Street Journal's CFO Network Summit, at 3:30 p.m.

Central-bank decisions: The European Central Bank is widely expected to make a further cut to interest rates. The announcement is due at 8:15 a.m.

Friday

Data: The February jobs report lands at 8:30 a.m. Nonfarm payrolls likely grew by 170,000 jobs, according to consensus estimates, up from 143,000 in January. Unemployment is seen steady at 4%.

Speakers: Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to speak at 12:30 p.m. on the economic outlook. Governors Michelle Bowman and Adriana Kugler are also slated to speak."

A total of 84,054 cars were registered in February compared with 84,886 in the same month last year, marking the fifth consecutive monthly decline, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said Wednesday.

Fleet registrations–which have driven previous market growth–fell by 4.0% on year, while private registrations rose by 4.6% and the much smaller business sector rose 3.3%.

Hybrid electric vehicle registrations rose 7.9% and plug-in hybrid registrations rose 19.3%, while battery electric vehicle registrations rose 41.7%, the SMMT said.

Battery electric vehicles took a 25.3% share of the market in February, which means its is currently running behind the U.K. government’s requirement of 28% for this year, the SMMT said.

The increase in EV sales during the month is unsurprising considering upcoming tax changes in April, which will see many EV models subject to the vehicle duty supplement for expensive cars for the first time, the SMMT added.

March is likely to see a further surge in EV uptake, as buyers take their last chance to avoid the tax and also capitalize on the new 2025 license plate registration that will be available from March 1.

“Although February’s figures show a subdued overall market, the good news is that electric car uptake is increasing,” SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said. “With the all-important March number plate change now upon us, and tax changes taking effect in April that will, perversely, dissuade EV purchases, we expect significant demand for these new products next month.”

The U.K.’s top two best-selling cars in February were the Mini Cooper and Tesla Model 3, according to the SMMT."

It’s eerie because that day was the starting point for the S&P 500’s quickest descent into a bear market in history.

President Trump surely doesn’t want to see this particular record broken while in office, and it’s unlikely anything as bad as a global pandemic will help it along—at least not so soon. But the odds of Trump owning both gold and silver medals in the stock-market high-dive rose after his speech to a joint session of Congress last night.

There was some hope earlier in the day for a quick end to hostilities after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested the president could “work something out” with Canada and Mexico—something he repeated after the speech and said might happen today. None of that could be heard in the president's address itself, though. Instead, Trump tried to prepare the home front in this trade war for a “little disturbance.”

Higher car prices are one thing, though. Will a president who almost views the Dow Jones Industrial Average as a personal approval rating be as comfortable with a major slump in stock prices?

We could find out. There’s been a notable surge in bearish sentiment in the long-running weekly AAII Investor Survey Sentiment Survey to one of its highest readings in history. The poll was conducted a week ago, before the latest tariff-induced market plunge, so the survey wrapping up tonight could show record pessimism.

One consolation: Rapid sentiment swings can signal a short-term buying opportunity since previous instances all have come near bear-market bottoms. Analysts at Evercore ISI calculate that the S&P 500 was down by 29% from its peak on average in the six previous cases of such high pessimism.Relief rallies notwithstanding, if we’re on the cusp of a bear market then it won’t look like the last one. That’s a good thing. The 2022 downturn came as inflation surged to a four-decade high while the Fed had pinned interest rates at zero since the Covid emergency. Rapid rate hikes continued in the face of investor losses.

In order to smooth volatility, very few people have all their money in stocks. Using bonds to diversify doesn’t always work, though, and it failed badly in 2022. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield started the year at a very low 1.51%. The Fed kept doling out bitter medicine that year through rate increases, pushing its yield above 4.3% by the fall.

That bear market in stocks was milder than most but, because of the bond swoon, a classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and Treasury notes had its second-worst year on record, adjusted for inflation.

By contrast, yields started off 2025 close to a multiyear high. Barring a simultaneous inflation spike and growth slump known as ""stagflation,"" bonds could provide an offset to stock losses.

That would hold especially true if the Fed moves to shore up growth by cutting rates further, in turn boosting bond prices and pushing down yields. Falling yields also would stimulate the economy in other ways such as lower corporate borrowing costs and mortgage rates.

Tariffs have pushed the economy closer to the edge. Investors have a decent safety net this time—if they need it."
2025-03-05 12:00:00+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcdonalds-gives-its-restaurants-an-ai-makeover-2134f01e,"McDonald’s is giving its 43,000 restaurants a technology makeover, starting with internet-connected kitchen equipment, artificial intelligence-enabled drive-throughs and AI-powered tools for managers.

The goal? To drive better experiences for its customers and workers who today contend with issues ranging from broken machines to wrong orders, according to Brian Rice, the Chicago-based burger giant’s chief information officer. 

“Our restaurants, frankly, can be very stressful. We have customers at the counter, we have customers at our drive-through, couriers coming in for delivery, delivery at curbside. That’s a lot to deal with for our crew,” Rice said in an interview. “Technology solutions will alleviate the stress.” 

The investments are coming at a key time for McDonald’s, whose U.S. sales were sluggish in January—reflective of a broader slump in the fast-food industry. McDonald’s said consumers remain pressured, particularly low-income diners and families. The restaurant is hoping that a better tech-enabled experience will help it deliver on its goal of growing its loyalty patrons from 175 million to 250 million by 2027. To accomplish that, McDonald’s tapped Google Cloud in late 2023 to bring more computing power to each of its restaurants—giving them the ability to process and analyze data on-site. The setup, known as edge computing, can be a faster, cheaper option than sending data to the cloud, especially in more far-flung locations with less reliable cloud connections, said Rice.

Rice joined McDonald’s in 2022 from Cardinal Health, where he also served as chief information officer. Before his tenure at the healthcare-supplies distributor, Rice served in senior technology positions at cereal maker Kellogg, candy-maker Mars and carmaker General Motors.

Edge computing will enable applications like predicting when kitchen equipment—such as fryers and its notorious McFlurry ice cream machines—is likely to break down, Rice said. The burger chain said its suppliers have begun installing sensors on kitchen equipment that will feed data to the edge computing system and give franchisees a “real-time” view into how their restaurants are operating. AI can then analyze that data for early signs of a maintenance problem. 

McDonald’s is also exploring the use of computer vision, the form of AI behind facial recognition, in store-mounted cameras to determine whether orders are accurate before they’re handed to customers, he said.

“If we can proactively address those issues before they occur, that’s going to mean smoother operations in the future,” Rice added. McDonald’s began rolling out edge computing to some U.S. restaurants in 2024, the company said, and plans to include more this year. It declined to say how many restaurants currently have edge cloud connectivity, and when the process will be completed. 

Additionally, the ability to tap edge computing will power voice AI at the drive-through, a capability McDonald’s is also working with Google’s cloud-computing arm to explore, Rice said. The company has been experimenting with voice-activated drive-throughs and robotic deep fryers since 2019, and ended its partnership with International Business Machines to test automated order-taking at the drive-through in 2024.

Edge computing will also help McDonald’s restaurant managers oversee their in-store operations. The burger giant is looking to create a “generative AI virtual manager,” Rice said, which handles administrative tasks such as shift scheduling on managers’ behalf. Fast-food giant Yum Brands’ Pizza Hut and Taco Bell have explored similar capabilities. 

McDonald’s is an early mover in its industry when it comes to using edge computing, but it’s by no means alone, according to Jose Gomes, a managing director of retail and consumer goods at Google Cloud. The technology is expected to be used by any sector with distributed physical locations, including hospitals and factories.Despite its first-mover advantage, McDonald’s will still face challenges including cost and the difficulty of rolling out the same technology across franchises and corporate-owned locations, said Sandeep Unni, a retail analyst at market research and IT consulting firm Gartner. McDonald’s declined to say how much it is spending on its technology initiatives.  

But, compared with some of its quick-service restaurant peers, McDonald’s has been relatively aggressive at investing in new digital technologies, Unni said. That, combined with the vast amount of data it has collected on its customers, gives the fast-food giant a leg up on figuring out how to improve customer loyalty.

AI will be able to help McDonald’s tailor its promotions and offers by using customer data such as prior purchasing history, and even linking it with weather data, Rice said. “A customer who we know loves our sweet treats could get an offer through the app for a McFlurry on a hot summer day,” he said.

Markets across the board were on edge watching for developments in the tariffs that were implemented on Mexico and Canada, amid hopes that the Trump administration will negotiate to ease these tariffs on key products.

Gold has risen for three consecutive sessions, as the yellow metal’s role as a safe haven asset continues to be utilized. “Gold has traded higher for three days in a row… dominating safe haven flows in recent days versus President Trump’s 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada,” says Robert Yawger of Mizuho Securities USA in a note.

Gold Futures Rise on Safe-Haven Demand Though U.S. Premium Eases
1204 GMT – Gold futures rise on persistent safe-haven demand. Futures are up 0.2% at $2,926.80 a troy ounce. The precious metal has gained on a weaker dollar and a flight to safety as trade war risks intensify on President Trump’s tariff policy. That said, the difference between gold prices in the U.S. and Europe has narrowed as concerns over tight physical markets ease, SP Angel analysts say in a note. The premium on U.S. commodities exchange Comex over LBMA futures prices had risen as high as $60 an ounce in January on rising concerns that Trump would tariff gold, SP Angel says. Those fears have now faded, with the spread narrowing to around $10 an ounce, compared with a normal difference of $2 an ounce. Comex gold stockpiles have also risen to a four-year high, cooling short-squeeze concerns, SP Angel adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)

Base Metal Prices Rise; Aluminum Market Set for Deficit in 2025
1204 GMT – Base metal prices rise, with LME three-month copper up 1.5% at $9,526 a metric ton and LME three-month aluminum up 0.7% at $2,641.50 a ton. The global aluminum market is set to tighten to a 600,000 metric ton deficit in 2025, as slowing supply growth rubs up against stronger-than-expected demand, particularly in China, JPMorgan analysts say in a note. The around 3% compound annual growth in global primary supply seen over the last five years is expected to fall to just 1.3% on year in 2025, JPM says. Demand growth will face headwinds too, with tariff risks a serious concern, but global growth should still rise around 2%, analysts say. Higher aluminum costs on the back of 25% U.S. import tariffs should make U.S. restarts more likely in the coming quarters, JPM adds. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)

Base Metal Prices Rise on Softer Dollar, Chinese Growth Target
1032 GMT – Base metal prices rise, with LME three-month copper up 1.8% at $9,552 a metric ton and LME three-month aluminum up 0.9% at $2,646.50 a ton. The metals complex has gained on a weaker dollar, making it cheaper for international buyers to purchase dollar-denominated commodities. Support has also come from Chinese Premier Li Qiang’s announcement that China has set an economic growth goal of around 5% for 2025. While unchanged from last year, the target comes despite increased challenges from trade tensions and a moribund real estate sector. In order to increase investment, local government can issue up to 4.4 trillion yuan in special purpose bonds, usually used to fund infrastructure and development projects—a boon for industrial metals demand.

Gold Futures Gain as Escalating Trade War Prompts Flight to Safety
0903 GMT – Gold futures rise as President Trump’s trade policy continues to drive investors toward safe haven assets. Futures are up 0.3% at $2,930.60 a troy ounce, rising close to its all-time high of $2,974.0 an ounce set in late February. The enforcement from Tuesday of import tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods, as well as an increase of China levies, has prompted a surge in gold buying, Pepperstone’s Ahmad Assiri says in a note. This activity has cemented the precious metal’s position as the go-to safe haven amid trade upheavals and often conflicting, rapid-fire developments, Assiri writes. The rally is expected to persist, especially as retaliatory efforts from Canada and Mexico would likely be unveiled this weekend, Assiri adds. The bullish momentum seen in Comex gold futures is likely reaccelerating, RHB Retail Research’s Joseph Chai says in a note, citing Tuesday’s “higher low” bullish candlestick on the daily chart. The futures contract has reclaimed ground above the 20-day simple moving average, signaling that gold bulls now have the technical “upper hand,” the analyst says. “Riding on this renewed momentum, we expect the commodity to continue its bullish trajectory” toward $3,000/oz followed by $3,100/oz, Chai says. As long as the futures contract remains above the $2,800/oz support level, the technical setup remains bullish, the analyst adds. Spot gold is little changed at $2,917.85/oz."

The German sporting-goods company embarked on its own revamp after Bjorn Gulden took the helm in 2023, taking steps to reposition its brand and clear out excess inventory. The company said its sales in North America and the region that includes China returned to double-digit growth in the fourth quarter.

For 2025, Adidas anticipates currency-neutral sales growth at a high-single-digit rate, it said Wednesday. It also forecasts an increase in operating profit to between 1.7 billion and 1.8 billion euros ($1.81 billion-$1.91 billion).

Adidas completed last year the sale of the remaining Yeezy-branded sneakers from a collaboration with rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and said its 2025 guidance doesn’t include any Yeezy revenue or profit.

The company enters 2025 in good shape and sees potential to increase its market share in all regions, Gulden said.

“We could have the ambition of being number one in all markets except in the U.S.,” the CEO said during a call after results.

Meanwhile, rival Nike continues to pursue a turnaround led by Chief Executive Elliott Hill, aiming to regain some of the market share it lost to its competitors after years of missteps under the leadership of John Donahoe. Analysts at UBS said in a note prior to the results that Adidas should be able to gain shelf space with wholesaler partners amid continuing weakness at Nike.

Adidas expects sales for its namesake brand to grow at a double-digit rate in markets including North America. Sales growth accelerated in the region to 15% in the fourth quarter excluding currency movements, driven by improvements in the wholesale channel as well as the company’s own retail stores.

In the region that includes China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, Adidas reported sales growth of 16% at constant currency for the quarter.

The company reported a narrowed net loss of 39 million euros for the fourth quarter compared with a loss of 379 million euros in the prior-year period.

However, shares in Adidas were down 2.2% in European morning trade, while Germany’s DAX blue-chip index was up 2.9%.

Investors are likely to be underwhelmed by Adidas’s outlook, though uncertainty about trade tariffs added risk to the consumer backdrop, analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note to clients.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Piral Dadhania expects the company to beat its guidance this year. In 2024, it also issued a cautious outlook to manage expectations and be in a position to beat and raise guidance later, the analyst said.

“The uncertainty in the U.S. is there. We have no idea what will happen, so we are conservative,” the CEO said.

As part of the revamp, the group wants to be closer to the consumer and give its local teams more authority. “Less decision-making in the headquarters requires fewer people,” Chief Financial Officer Harm Ohlmeyer said.

It has identified up to 500 roles that are obsolete in its headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany. Gulden noted that some people will leave the group, while others will be relocated.

The company confirmed preliminary figures released in January with quarterly sales of 5.965 billion euros, up 24% on year. It swung to an operating profit of 57 million euros from a loss of 377 million euros.

Adidas proposed a dividend of 2 euros a share, up from 70 cents a share the year prior.

German Fiscal Expansion Set to Lead to Rise in Global Risk-Free Bond Rate
0940 GMT – German Bunds will now become less scarce but Germany will continue to have the best fiscal fundamentals, even with the large debt expansion announced, says T.Rowe Price’s Tomasz Wieladek in a note. “Since many global bond yields trade relative to Bunds, the German government’s action is equivalent to raising the global risk-free bond rate,” T.Rowe’s chief European economist says. Even U.S. Treasurys, historically the center of all bond markets, may over time sell off significantly in response to higher Bund yields, he says.

U.S. Treasurys Are Relative Outperformers Vs Bunds After Germany’s Spending Decision
0829 GMT – Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields rise modestly, showing muted reaction to a significant selloff in eurozone government bonds, making them a relative outperformer versus German Bunds. The 10-year Treasury yield rises 3 basis points, last trading at 4.242%, according to Tradeweb. Earlier in the day, the 10-year Bund yield rose to 2.728%, the highest since end-May, after Germany’s decision to exempt defense spending from fiscal rules. The 10-year Bund yield last trades at 2.686%, up 20.5 basis points, Tradeweb data shows. German’s Fiscal Change Seen as Watershed Moment for Bunds
The shift in Germany’s fiscal stance is likely to have far-reaching implications for Bunds, Barclays Research’s Rohan Khanna says in a note. While execution risks of the ambitious plan are a medium-term issue, cheaper Bunds with 10-year yields beyond 2.75%, steeper curves and tighter asset swap spreads seem the path of least resistance in the short-term, the strategist says. Germany’s Christian Democratic Union, its Bavarian sister party and the Social Democrats agreed on a large fiscal expansion, subject to parliamentary approval next week. Earlier in the day, German 10-year Bund yields rose to 2.728%, the highest level since end-May 2024, before retreating to 2.691%, up 21 basis points, according to Tradeweb data.German Bunds look set to continue to underperform while risk sentiment could improve, says Commerzbank Research’s Christoph Rieger in a note. That would imply lower demand for safe-haven assets, like Bunds. Germany’s CDU/CSU and SPD parties agreed on a major fiscal package, subject to parliamentary approval, exempting military expenditure from the country’s strict fiscal rules. Christian Democrat (CDU) Friedrich Merz, the likely future chancellor, said “given the threats to our freedom and to peace on the continent, we must do whatever it takes,” in reference to rising geopolitical tensions. His comments remind investors of former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s “whatever it takes” speech in July 2012, which was widely seen as the turnaround point in the eurozone’s debt crisis.Beijing may accelerate bond issuance and spending in coming months, Goldman Sachs analysts say, noting that the fiscal targets announced today likely do not fully factor in the 20% additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. There is a possibility for extra-budget funding later this year given Beijing’s ambitious GDP growth target of around 5%, they say. The 2025 quotas for both central government and local government special bonds net issuance is slightly below market expectations. This implies a smaller-than-expected government funding arrangement for bank recapitalization and consumer goods trade-in program this year, GS says. Investors should watch for the fiscal budget report, interviews with key ministers and President Xi’s concluding remarks for the rest of Two Sessions, they add."

Dollar Tree on Wednesday said Glendinning joined the Chesapeake, Va., company in January in a senior role focused on transformation initiatives, including the review of strategic alternatives for Family Dollar, the chain it acquired in a $9 billion deal in 2015.

Dollar Tree said last year that it would explore a potential sale or spinoff of Family Dollar, which has weighed on its financial results, and that it would close nearly 1,000 Family Dollar stores over several years. Before joining Dollar Tree, Glendinning served as chief executive of Express, where he oversaw the fashion retailer’s bankruptcy and sale to brand-management firm WHP Global and mall owners Simon Property Group, Brookfield Properties and Centennial Real Estate. He also served a more than four-year stint as chief financial officer of meat processor Tyson Foods.

Dollar Tree said in December that Jeff Davis had agreed to step down as chief financial officer, a post he has held since joining the company in late 2022, and that it had launched a search for a new finance chief.

Dollar Tree said Glendinning, 59 years old, will receive an annual base salary of $950,000 and an annual bonus with a target of 100% of his base pay.

European Gas Price Falls After EU Proposal on Storage Targets
1416 GMT – Europe’s natural-gas prices fall more than 3% in afternoon trade after the European Commission proposed to introduce a greater degree of flexibility for filling gas storage this year. The EU’s executive arm aims to extend a requirement to fill storage caverns by at least 90% by Nov. 1 for two years, but said the overall framework to meet this target must be flexible and that interim targets are “indicative.” The benchmark Dutch TTF contract is down to 42.16 euros a megawatt hour. “The pullback today is related to investment funds yet again cutting their long-positions to the lowest level since late-July as well as the more flexibility added to the interim storage targets,” Rabobank’s energy strategist Florence Schmit says. “The EU delaying proposals to the Russian gas phase out roadmap has also added to this sentiment.” 0923 GMT – European natural-gas prices edge higher in early trading following the previous session’s decline, with the benchmark Dutch TTF contract up 0.4% to 43.75 euros a megawatt hour. “The European natural gas market sold off yesterday with TTF settling nearly 3.9% lower on the day,” ING’s Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey say. “We believe that the weakness is overdone given the tighter storage environment.” EU storage levels are currently 37.6% full, well below the five-year average. Meanwhile, growing uncertainties over the path to end the war in Ukraine continue to weigh on sentiment. “The geopolitical backdrop remains fractured,” ANZ Research analysts say, highlighting that a peace agreement could pave the way for the return of some Russian gas flows."

Trade tensions weighed on major indexes early in the session, even as fresh economic data suggested the U.S. service sector last month grew faster than Wall Street’s expectations. But stocks turned sharply higher after President Trump granted automakers the one-month exemption from 25% duties.

Ford Motor stock climbed 5.8% and General Motors added 7.2%, with both companies’ shares among the leaders in the S&P 500. Stellantis jumped 9.2%.

Still, traders are bracing for more volatility ahead. Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke Wednesday on tariffs with no apparent breakthrough in the trade tensions between the two countries.

At the same time, a mounting pile of data suggests consumers’ inflation expectations are climbing and the U.S. economy is slowing. A monthly ADP National Employment report on Wednesday showed hiring in the U.S. private sector slowed markedly in February.

Trump made a brief reference to the prospect of higher consumer prices because of his tariffs in an address to Congress Tuesday. “There will be little disturbance,” he said. “We’re okay with that.”

Turner, 70 years old, sat in the House chamber Tuesday night for President Trump’s speech to the joint session of Congress. His family, in a statement reported by Houston media, said Turner was taken to the hospital after the speech and was later released. Then, early Wednesday morning, he died at his home from “enduring health complications.” The statement didn’t provide further details.

Turner had won the seat of another recently deceased House Democrat, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D., Texas), who died after a pancreatic cancer diagnosis.

“This comes as a shock to everyone,” said current Houston Mayor John Whitmire.

Turner’s sudden death will have an immediate impact on the House: Republicans now have slightly more cushion as Democrats await a special election to fill the seat. With his death, the GOP majority now stands at 218-214.

The House GOP majority math is so slim that the confirmation of Rep. Elise Stefanik (R., N.Y.) to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations has been held up as Republicans wait to fill the seats of former Reps. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.) and Mike Waltz (R., Fla.). The special elections for both Florida seats are set to take place on April 1. Stefanik has continued to serve in the House for now.

Turner had posted to social media Tuesday night, including a video on X where he said: “My message to the current administration for tonight’s State of the Union: ‘Don’t mess with Medicaid.’ ”

Turner had previously been diagnosed with bone cancer while he served as the mayor of Houston, a position he held from 2016 to 2024. According to an interview with Houston Chronicle in 2022, he said he was cancer free after secretly battling with the disease. 

It wasn’t immediately clear when Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott will call a special election for Turner’s seat. 

Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows said in a post on X that Turner’s “decades of public service—from the halls of the Legislature to Houston City Hall and, most recently, our nation’s Capitol—leave behind a legacy of leadership and advocacy for the people of Houston.”"
2025-03-05 16:00:03+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/canada-mexico-tariff-anger-nationalism-f8a45d18,"The U.S. has long exerted an almost gravitational pull on its neighbors. Canada’s automobile industry is hardwired to that of the U.S. and people flit back and forth across the border to shop, visit or commute to work.

Large tracts of northern Mexico are populated by factories supplying the vast market a short distance across the border. Border towns including Ciudad Juárez and Reynosa still follow the U.S. clock while the rest of the country uses standard time year-round.
But now there is a growing feeling that things have radically changed in the U.S. Both Canada and Mexico are wondering how—and whether they can—shift their orbit to avoid any further whiplash from President Trump’s imposition of 25% tariffs on goods imported from the neighbors.

In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday called on Canadians to stand up to the assault from the tariffs after Trump has mocked the Canadian leader as “governor” while repeatedly calling for annexing U.S.’s northern neighbor and turning it into the “51st state.” 

Canadians are increasingly canceling U.S. vacations and calling for boycotts of U.S. food at grocery stores, while government-owned liquor retailers are removing U.S. wine and spirits from their shelves.

Sports fans have booed the American national anthem and have turned on Canadian hockey legend Wayne Gretzky because of his close friendship with Trump. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, said Tuesday that it canceled a $100 million contract with Elon Musk’s Starlink and was banning all U.S.-based companies from participating in government procurement.

“Canadians are reasonable and we are polite, but we will not back down from a fight, not when our country and the well-being of everyone in it is at stake,” Trudeau said Tuesday in public remarks. “Donald, they point out that even though you’re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.”

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has taken a less confrontational approach with Trump, which some saw as a model for other countries to follow before Mexico was hit by tariffs. She has reacted coolly to Trump’s continually painting her government as being in collusion with drug traffickers, calling the latest statement “offensive, defamatory and groundless.” While Mexico hasn’t yet seen the same kind of surge in nationalism as Canada, Sheinbaum plans to rally her country Sunday from the Zocalo, the monumental square at the heart of Mexico City, where she said she would announce retaliatory tariffs and other measures on U.S. goods before tens of thousands of supporters. 

For decades, the Zocalo has been the place where Mexico’s presidents have gone to make momentous announcements. A huge Mexican flag flies in the middle of the square where every September the president rings a bell to celebrate Mexican independence. 

This time Sheinbaum, whose approval rating has shot up to 85% as she deals with Trump, will ask the Mexican people for their support in a crisis that threatens to push the country into an economic slump. 

“I call on the people of Mexico to face this challenge together,” Sheinbaum said Tuesday, announcing the meeting. “Let’s maintain our unity.”

Some 70% of Mexicans have a negative opinion of Trump, while 60% have a positive opinion of Americans, said Francisco Abundis, director of Parametría, a Mexican polling company. 

But that may change with the imposition of tariffs. “We could see the beginning of a period of anti-Americanism, which we haven’t seen since the 1980s,” said Abundis. 

Fernando Farrera, a taxi driver in Mexico’s southern border city of Tapachula, said he is bracing for the effects of an economic crisis that he expects will send food prices up. He thinks Mexico now needs to distance itself from the U.S. “It’s not possible that they are doing this to us,” he said. “What that clown Donald Trump wants is to have us under his thumb, under his power. But we aren’t going to submit to his whims.” 

Since Trump announced the tariffs, Canadian and Mexican officials have sought to address his demands to strengthen their border policies to stop migrant and drug flows into the U.S. “There is no indication that anything is satisfying the administration,” said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a security expert at the Brookings Institution. She said the tariffs could cause Mexico to reduce cooperation with the U.S., including with regard to immigration. “This would be a big blow for the Trump administration, which has centered so much of its efforts on anti-migration.”

Others say Sheinbaum is unlikely to take actions that could infuriate Trump and lead to even more hostile acts from the U.S. president.   

Despite the growing unity against Trump in Canada and Mexico, analysts say there is little that nationalism can do to solve the economic problem of tariffs for two countries that bet heavily on trade with the U.S.  

“She can fill the Zocalo, but it’s all show, it’s all domestic theater. The problem is, what can she do?” said Jorge Castañeda, a former Mexican foreign minister, referring to Sheinbaum’s planned rally on Sunday. “Very little.”

Mexico has shared a fraught history with the U.S. that has seen two American invasions, including one in 1846 that led to the loss of half its territory. But anti-Americanism has largely disappeared since the 1994 free-trade agreement led to integration of the two countries’ economies.

Millions of Mexicans work in businesses that export to the U.S. or depend on American tourism. Others rely on remittances that come from millions of Mexican-Americans or Mexican migrants living in the U.S.  

Mexico’s reliance on the U.S. for more than 80% of its exports leaves the country with few alternatives in the short and medium term, said Greg Husisian, a partner at law firm Foley & Lardner. “It’s not like Mexico can move to the other major trading partner, which would be either the EU, or China,” he said. “They’ve been trying to court the EU for years and it’s only resulted in a moderate uptick,” he said, referring to the European Union. 

The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, “has been a very real success story, particularly for the Mexican automotive sector and they’re not going to give up on that easily,” Husisian said.

Canada, which is bracing for a recession because of the tariffs, stressed its shared history with the U.S. in a bid to avert the tariffs, noting that its soldiers fought and died alongside Americans from World War II to Afghanistan. Like Mexico, whose gross domestic product could fall 3% amid a trade war, Canada has highlighted that its relationship with the U.S. has led to mutual economic prosperity.  

Trudeau has responded with retaliatory tariffs targeting about $100 billion of U.S. imports. And Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a conservative, said he would place an export tax on electricity sent to homes in Minnesota, Michigan and New York. He has threatened to halt nickel exports to the U.S. 

“It doesn’t make sense to attack your closest ally, your strongest neighbor in the entire world,” Ford told The Wall Street Journal. “But we don’t blame the American people. It’s one person, and that’s President Trump.” Sheinbaum is likely to impose retaliatory tariffs on products from Republican districts in the hope that companies and officials from affected states will lobby in Washington for their removal, according to analysts.

Luis de la Calle, a former Mexican trade negotiator, said Mexico has successfully imposed retaliatory tariffs at least five times before, leading the U.S. to repeal its own tariffs. “Governors and businessmen will have to advocate for their own states,” he said. “They know what an important role Mexico and Canada play in their states.”

Mexican officials are angry that the tariffs were imposed even though the government responded to Trump’s demands that it act to curtail the flow of fentanyl and migrants to the U.S. In an unprecedented move, last week Mexico sent the U.S. 29 drug bosses who were facing charges in the U.S. 

A Mexican federal security official said the tariffs are a slap in the face given the results the country delivered, and show that the level of bilateral cooperation doesn’t matter. 

“The tariffs show that Trump’s economic and political decisions are geared to his political base more than they are to maintain a real relationship with his allies,” he said."
2025-03-05 19:00:05+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-deportation-flights-paused-cost-c37c577a,"The Trump administration has stopped using military aircraft to fly migrants who entered the U.S. illegally to Guantanamo Bay or other countries, defense officials said.

President Trump has made a crackdown on illegal immigration a focus of his second term. But using military aircraft to transport some migrants to their home countries or to a military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has proved expensive and inefficient, The Wall Street Journal has reported.

The last military deportation flight was March 1, officials said. The Pentagon said Tuesday that no such flights were scheduled for the next 48 hours. A flight scheduled for Thursday was canceled, a defense official said. The pause on such flights could be extended or made permanent, officials said.

Soon after Trump took office in January, his administration began using military aircraft for flights traditionally handled by the Department of Homeland Security to transfer some migrants to other countries and to U.S. military facilities at Guantanamo Bay. The administration wanted the military flights to send a message about its intent to get tough on immigrants in the country illegally, defense officials said.

“The message is clear: If you break the law, if you are a criminal, you can find your way at Guantanamo Bay,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said last week after watching migrants arrive on a C-130 aircraft during a visit to Guantanamo Bay. “You don’t want to be at Guantanamo Bay.”

The Trump administration has conducted roughly 30 migrant flights using C-17 aircraft and about a dozen on C-130s, according to flight-tracking data. Destinations included India, Guatemala, Ecuador, Peru, Honduras, Panama and Guantanamo Bay.

But the military flights have taken longer routes and transported fewer migrants at higher cost to taxpayers than the government’s typical deportation flights on civilian aircraft, the Journal found.

Three deportation flights to India cost $3 million each. Some flights carried a dozen people to Guantanamo at a cost of at least $20,000 for a migrant, the Journal’s analysis showed.A standard U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement flight costs $8,500 per flight hour, according to a government webpage. Former ICE officials told the Journal the figure is closer to $17,000 per flight hour for international trips.

It costs $28,500 per hour to fly a C-17, which is designed to carry heavy cargo and troops, according to U.S. Transportation Command, which provided the aircraft.

Adding to costs, the C-17s haven’t been using Mexico’s airspace, which can add several hours to flights destined for Central and South America. Mexico and some other countries in Latin America haven’t allowed the military flights to land and have instead sent their own aircraft or arranged for deportees to travel on commercial flights.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro in January denied entry to two C-17 flights, prompting Trump to threaten tariffs. Hours later, the White House said Colombia had agreed to the “unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens,” including on U.S. military aircraft. But no C-17s have landed in the country. Instead, Colombia sent its own aircraft to transport deported Colombians.

Venezuela in February sent two commercial flights to pick up 190 people, ending years of refusals to accept deported citizens who had entered the U.S. illegally."
2025-03-05 21:23:11+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/trump-nih-research-rate-cap-judge-blocked-1b368898,"BOSTON—A federal judge on Wednesday extended a freeze on the Trump administration’s changes to research funding through the National Institutes of Health, in the latest legal setback for the president’s efforts to slash government spending. 

The preliminary injunction from U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley in Massachusetts pauses the administration’s proposed 15% rate cap on indirect research costs funded by NIH. It was issued in response to lawsuits filed by multiple groups, including the Association of American Medical Colleges, and 22 state attorneys general who argued that the funding caps would cause irreparable damage to scientific and medical research efforts.

The judge said the sudden rate shift threatened such significant harm to patients, laboratory animals and scientific studies that it was necessary to stop it from going into effect while court proceedings continue. She had previously put in place a restraining order while considering the request for a longer halt. 

“Human safety and scientific integrity are immeasurably compromised by NIH’s slash-and-cap approach,” wrote Kelley, a Biden appointee. “The Court is hard pressed to think of a loss more irreparable than the loss of a life, let alone the thousands of people who are counting on clinical trials as their last hope.”

NIH is the principal source of federal funding for medical and public-health research in the U.S., with over $35 billion in grants paid out in the last fiscal year. Most of that funding goes toward direct costs, such as researcher salaries and lab supplies. NIH also contributes a percentage of grants to shared expenses at research centers, such as heating and ventilation, biosafety equipment and staff including security guards and administrative personnel. 

This funding category, known as indirect costs, varies widely among institutions. Research centers negotiate rates for indirect costs with the federal government, which can range from 15% to over 90% at top scientific hubs. Last year, spending on those fees accounted for a quarter of total research funding from NIH. 

Those indirect costs are now in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s efficiency efforts. The Feb. 7 announcement of a blanket 15% cap on indirect costs sent shock waves through academic circles, threw universities and scientists into uproar and drew concern from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. 

“In addition to consuming resources, indirect costs are difficult to track, making it hard for a grantor like NIH to determine whether the money—in the case of NIH, public money—it provides is actually funding the research it intends,” the administration said in a previous court filing.

In a court hearing last month, lawyers representing the plaintiffs argued that NIH’s abrupt notice violated the federal rule-making process and would cause irreparable harm to scientific and medical research efforts.

“Laboratories will be closed, graduate students will be fired, clinical trials will be stopped,” a lawyer for the plaintiffs warned at the hearing.

Plaintiffs welcomed the order. “This is a major win for research institutions across the country—in both red and blue states—that rely on NIH funding to conduct innovative research, as well as for the individuals and families who depend on these medical advancements to improve and even save their lives,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell.

What will be the impact of cutting funding for medical research? Join the conversation below.

During Trump’s first term, the administration similarly endeavored to reduce indirect cost rates funded through NIH. That effort was ultimately blocked by Congress. The latest proposal is estimated to save $4 billion this year, according to a tweet from NIH that was later refuted in court by the attorney representing the administration.

“That tweet was, at best, a misunderstanding,” said Brian Lea, lead attorney for the administration said during the court hearing. “This is not about cutting down funding, this about changing slices of the pie.”

Universities have argued the changes would have far-ranging consequences. Brown University in Rhode Island anticipated cutting over 200 jobs if the cuts went into effect. Johns Hopkins University in Maryland said 600 ongoing clinical trials would be threatened. Harvard University said the funding supported data storage and computing capacity for cancer research.

Lucio Miele, director of the LSU LCMC Health Cancer Center in New Orleans, said NIH’s cuts would curtail hiring of faculty and could prevent the school from purchasing software that supports the administration of clinical trials: “We don’t know for sure if we’re going to have the money to buy it."

2025-03-05T22:23:29Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/624891/ai-generated-review-summaries-coming-to-apples-app-store,"Apple is bringing AI-generated review summaries to the app store with iOS 18.4. As spotted by Macworld, the latest developer beta for iOS and iPadOS adds brief summaries of user reviews to some App Store listings.

The summaries are generated by large language models to “compile highlights and key information from users’ reviews into short paragraphs,” according to details on Apple’s developer site.

Based on Apple’s example, the summaries use natural language to highlight what users say about the app, starting with positive feedback and finishing with negative feedback. Apple says the summaries will be refreshed at least once a week as new reviews are added, and users will be able to tap and hold on a review to report any problems with the feature.


The summaries will initially be available in the US App Store for apps and games published in English, and only to those with enough reviews to generate a summary. They will be available in other countries and languages later this year.

Apple’s move follows Amazon’s addition of AI-generated review highlights to its e-commerce site in 2023. These short paragraphs “highlight the product features and customer sentiment frequently mentioned across written reviews” and appear above the full reviews.

In theory, review summaries should be helpful, saving you from reading through a bunch of reviews to get the “highlights.” But they also feel potentially ripe for gaming and will likely only encourage unscrupulous companies to flood review sections.

From my experience with Amazon’s summaries, I find that its focus on the positive aspects first can feel disingenuous. I review products for a living, and if something is bad, that will absolutely be the first thing I say."

2025-03-05T22:39:53Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/624904/cfpb-digital-payments-musk-x-conflict-doge,"The Senate voted on Wednesday to strip a key financial regulator of its ability to monitor digital platforms like X, as the social media company’s owner, Elon Musk, has become the public face of the government office seeking to shrink the agency’s workforce.

The resolution, which still requires House approval, would effectively moot a rule finalized by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) last year establishing its authority to monitor digital payment offerings, just as it already supervises traditional financial institutions and products. Republicans who introduced the resolution say it’s a necessary correction to the CFPB’s overreach and will ensure the agency doesn’t stand in the way of innovation.

With the CFPB’s digital authority now in danger, two Democrats are calling on the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) to probe Musk’s compliance with federal ethics laws, given his financial interests and work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). In a letter shared exclusively with The Verge, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Adam Schiff (D-CA) are asking the OGE to preserve communications about Musk and DOGE’s compliance. They ask whether Musk has recused himself from DOGE’s work at the CFPB or if he’s been issued ethics waivers to address conflicts of interest that might be raised by his ownership of X and leadership at Tesla, which offers financing to auto customers.

DOGE — of which Musk has become the face despite administration officials denying he actually runs it — has been a driving force behind terminations and stop-work orders at the CFPB, prompting a lawsuit from its workers union claiming the Trump administration is violating the separation of powers by trying to cut off congressionally funded work.

The White House has previously offered vague assurances that Musk would not work on matters that present a conflict of interest

The CFPB rule that Republicans are trying to get rid of would let the agency keep tabs on digital services like X’s planned venture into payments for fraud and privacy issues. That raised concerns that Musk could be serving his own financial interests in kneecapping a regulator that would have direct oversight of at least one of his businesses. The White House has previously offered vague assurances that Musk would not work on matters that present a conflict of interest, but he hasn’t done much to distance himself publicly from DOGE’s work at the CFPB. He posted “CFPB RIP” on his X account in the wake of an initial stop-work order issued to the agency.

The video player is currently playing an ad.
“Notably, the CFPB has taken steps in recent years to protect consumers from fraud on digital payment apps and collects proprietary information from the digital payment industry,” Warren and Schiff write in their letter to the OGE. “Mr. Musk is also the founder and CEO of Tesla, which offers customers the option of working with Tesla to finance their auto purchases. The CFPB plays a critical role in supervising the auto lending industry and protecting consumers from corporate malfeasance and scams. Therefore, actions by Mr. Musk and DOGE at the CFPB have the potential to directly benefit X, Visa, and Tesla—and by extension, Mr. Musk.”

Musk has been dubbed a “special government employee” by the Trump administration, which the lawmakers point out makes him subject to conflict of interest laws. “Therefore, if Mr. Musk has taken actions in his federal role that will benefit his financial interests without receiving appropriate waivers and approvals, he may have violated the criminal conflict of interest statute.”

Ahead of the Senate vote on Wednesday, Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) framed the choice to his colleagues succinctly: “A vote in favor of this resolution is a vote to strip federal oversight of Elon Musk’s payments company.”"

2025-03-06T15:54:23Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/625219/taylor-swift-eras-cybercrime-stubhub,"Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour ended last year, but authorities have finally apprehended a pair of thieves who managed to steal hundreds of tickets by exploiting a loophole in StubHub’s back end.
Per The Hollywood Reporter, two cybercriminals who stole and re-sold hundreds of digital tickets to different concerts and sporting events like the U.S. Open have been arrested by police. Tyrone Rose and Shamara Simmons have been charged with grand larceny, computer tampering, and conspiracy. If found guilty, the pair could face anywhere from 3-15 years in prison. Rose and Simmons are set to appear in court and submit their pleas this Friday, but the police’s investigation will continue as they are said to have worked with a number of accomplices — at least one of whom is now dead, while another has yet to be caught.
According to the Queens District Attorney’s Office, Rose, Simmons, and other members of the crime ring obtained the tickets by intercepting legitimate StubHub URLs generated after legal ticket purchases. Those ill-gotten URLs would then be passed along to other participants in the scheme, who would use them to resell the tickets on StubHub itself. Between June 2022 and July 2023, the crew managed to re-sell about 900 tickets for shows including Swift, Adele, and Ed Sheeran for about $600,000. It’s not entirely clear how the group’s plan first came together, but it seems as if they were able to discover the exploit because some of them worked for Sutherland Global Services, a Kingston-based IT contractor. In the wake of the news, StubHub terminated its working relationship with Sutherland.

In a statement about the case, Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said that the crime ring wanted to “use the popularity of Taylor Swift’s concert tour and other high-profile events to profit at the expensive of others.”

Katz added that “This takedown highlights the vigilance of my office’s Cybercrime and Cryptocurrency Unit as well as the importance of working with our industry partners to combat fraudulent activities and ensure the protection of consumers.”"

Jackbox aims to launch a beta of the service on “one or two smart TV platforms in the Spring of 2025.”
Generally, Jackbox titles are offered in bundles called “Party Packs” that you can play on platforms like game consoles and PCs. This new native smart TV app could make it easier to jump into a Jackbox game, since you won’t need to launch the titles from a device like a game console.

Well, you can imagine our surprise to read that the company’s RTX 50-series laptop GPUs might be affected as well, with Heise Online and Hardwareluxx reporting that Nvidia has asked manufacturers to check their laptops for fewer ROPs than promised.
But Nvidia tells The Verge there isn’t actually a problem with those notebook GPUs. “All partners continue to run checks as part of our standard testing procedure,” Nvidia GeForce global PR director Ben Berraondo tells us, adding that Nvidia will reach out to both German publications to discuss.
We asked very specifically:

Did we just go from “no other GPUs are affected” to ‘“some laptop GPUs” are also affected?
The answer was “Nope.”
Just to triple-check, the “nope” means that no laptop GPUs are affected by the missing ROP issue, yes?
“Correct, no further issues,” says Berraondo.
That’s a fairly categorical denial, and it sounds like laptop buyers can expect to find the full complement of ROPs in their Nvidia 50-series laptops either way — either because there never was an issue to begin with or because there’s no longer an issue now that partners will catch it during these tests.
Both Heise and Hardwareluxx have suggested that these tests are unusual in one way: some laptops may be delivered in April or May instead of planned March release dates. However, Heise also reports one other possible reason for delays: that “Nvidia only recently distributed the final vBIOS for the notebook GPUs,” according to Google Translate."

But this morning’s launch, while better than recent Nvidia launches in terms of supply, may not have met that bar — and AMD would not deny reports that even the best-priced models of these GPUs are capped to specific quantities, after which they may be sold at higher than $549 or $599.
* 		RelatedOur AMD Radeon RX 9070 / 9070 XT review
When The Verge checked this morning, major US retailers Best Buy and Newegg listed as few as a single model of each GPU at their MSRP, which sold out quickly, of course. Most cards are listed for a $100 premium over that MSRP, if not more.
Micro Center appears to be doing far better, with as many as five 9070s and five 9070 XTs at MSRP and a website that claims they’re even still available for purchase if you visit one of its 28 US locations in person.
What happens next? It’s not unusual for each graphics card partner to sell a variety of fancier grades of the same GPU at higher prices with fancier cooling and overclocking — but retailers are now suggesting that even the prices of entry-level cards won’t hold.
“We have now learned how the recommended prices, also known as MSRP prices, work for the launch of the AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT […] they will apply to a limited number of cards,” wrote Swedish retailer Inet.se, as documented by VideoCardz.
“MSRP is capped quantity of a few hundred, so prices will jump once those are sold through,” UK retailer Overclockers UK also reportedly wrote.
Even Best Buy seemed to suggest that $549 / $599 prices were only temporary. When we visited this morning, the Best Buy website described them like they were on sale, though the company has since removed the “save $80” and “save $130” you see below. AMD says the Best Buy listings were an error.


We asked AMD:
* 		Can you confirm or deny that the best prices on the best-priced cards are capped in this way?
* 		Can you confirm or deny that only a fraction of the best-priced models of 9070 and 9070 XT will be sold at their announced MSP?
* 		Can you confirm or deny that AMD has okayed any board partners or retailers whatsoever to raise their prices beyond MSRP after selling through a certain quantity or certain number of shipments?

AMD would not confirm or deny. It did address the larger question of MSRP availability with this statement from chief gaming solutions architect (and gaming marketing boss) Frank Azor, though:
It is inaccurate that $549 / $599 MSRP is launch-only pricing. We expect cards to be available from multiple vendors at $549 / $599 (excluding region specific tariffs and / or taxes) based on the work we have done with our AIB partners, and more are coming. At the same time, the AIBs have different premium configurations at higher price points and those will also continue.
On X, Azor tweeted that AMD is working to replenish stock “in the coming days and weeks,” adding, “MSRP pricing (excluding region specific tariffs and/or taxes) will continue to be encouraged beyond today so don’t despair.”

2025-03-06T22:46:31Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/625671/fcc-vote-gps-911-technologies-inquiry,"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) plans to vote on an inquiry to explore alternatives to GPS, FCC chair Brendan Carr says in a blog post.
Carr says that while GPS has been “indispensable,” the technology “isn’t infallible” and that “disruptions to GPS have the potential to undermine the nation’s economic and national security.” Carr says that “we need to develop redundant technologies,” which is why the FCC will “vote on an inquiry to explore other Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) systems” that can serve as “complements or alternatives” to GPS.
In addition to GPS, Carr also says the commission will vote on two proposals regarding 911 technology. One is “a proposal to update our existing rules to ensure the resiliency, reliability, interoperability, and accessibility” of “Next Generation 911,” or NG911, which is internet-connected emergency tech that will eventually replace legacy 911 systems.

Another is a proposal to “strengthen our 911 location accuracy rules” to potentially improve the information first responders receive about a person’s location, including the ability to more accurately find callers on specific floors in buildings."

Today, Amazon Prime announced that it has secured the rights to stream dubbed and subbed versions of Gundam GQuuuuuuX, a new show produced by studio Khara, directed by Kazyua Tsurumaki, and co-written by Hideaki Anno and Yōji Enokido. Beginning April 8th, Amazon will begin streaming Gundam GQuuuuuuX in over over 240 countries as new episodes of the show simultaneously debut on Japanese television. GQuuuuuuX making its Western debut on Amazon tracks with the streamer’s recent moves to add highly-anticipated, Japanese animation like Tatsuki Fujimoto’s Look Back and Khara’s Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time to its catalog.

Tsurumaki — who previously directed the original FLCL anime — said in a statement that it was an honor to work on GQuuuuuuX and that he was excited for Western fans to see what his creative team has cooked up.


“FLCL was enjoyed by many fans overseas, which brought me great joy,” Tsurumaki said. “Now, after all these years, I am truly delighted to be able to present this new title through digital streaming. I sincerely hope audiences around the world will watch and enjoy it.”

2025-03-07T01:41:25Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/625753/apple-ios-alternative-app-stores-sideloading-brazil,"Apple has been told it has to allow alternative app stores on iOS in Brazil within 90 days, as reported by Brazilian publication Valor International and 9to5Mac. Apple has already been forced to allow third-party app stores on iOS in the EU due to the Digital Markets Act.

The judge who issued today’s ruling said that “Apple has already complied with similar obligations in other countries without demonstrating significant impact or irreparable harm to its economic model,” Valor reports.

Brazil’s investigation into Apple began with a complaint filed by Mercado Livre in 2022. In November, Brazil gave Apple 20 days to let developers offer alternative in-app payment options and allow sideloading, but in early December, the injunction was overturned.


The company plans to appeal the ruling, according to a statement shared with The Verge.

“Apple believes in vibrant and competitive markets where innovation can flourish,” spokesperson Fred Sainz says. “We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users. We are concerned that the interim measures proposed by CADE would undermine the privacy and security of our users and intend to appeal today’s decision.”

2025-03-07T09:55:46Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/625789/android-phones-lock-screen-widgets-16-qpr1,"Google has announced that lock screen widgets are coming to Android 16 phones later this year. Widgets have been available on the lock screen of the Pixel Tablet since last year, but Google is now bringing them to phones and more tablets.
All widgets will support the lock screen by default, though app developers will have the option to disable support if they prefer. Certain widget actions — such as triggering an app — will still require you to authenticate with a fingerprint, pin, or face unlock before they’ll function.
The upcoming change was announced on the Android Developers Blog, where the company confirmed that lock screen widgets will be added to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) in the first quarterly update following the release of Android 16, due in late summer. Android 16 itself is still in beta, and is due to release in June.

While the lock screen widgets for phones aren’t yet enabled in the latest Android 16 beta, Android Authority’s Mishaal Rahman managed to activate the functionality early. He found that while Pixel Tablet users can access lock screen widgets by swiping right from the home screen, the present implementation for phones is only available through Android’s screensaver mode, which requires the phone to be charging or docked. However, in its blog post Google notes that the mechanism to trigger the widget interface is customizable by hardware manufacturers, so we may see different approaches once the update arrives.

The other difference from the Pixel Tablet implementation comes down to screen size. Instead of a two-row grid of widgets, Rahman’s video shows widgets stacked vertically, with only space for a couple on the screen at once, so you’ll have to swipe through screens to access them all.

2025-03-07T11:46:10Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/625818/athena-moon-lander-intuitive-machines-nasa-sideways,"The second lunar lander made by Intuitive Machines has touched down on the Moon, but like the private aerospace company’s first spacecraft, it may not be upright. The Athena vehicle for Intuitive Machines IM-2 mission landed yesterday just 100 miles from the lunar south pole, but there’s uncertainty around its orientation which may impact the mission’s duration.

“We don’t believe we’re in the correct attitude on the surface of the Moon yet again,” Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said during the post-landing news conference.“We’re going to get a picture from the lunar reconnaissance orbital camera from above and we’ll confirm that over the coming days.”

Data from Athena’s Inertial Measurement Unit indicates that “we’re oriented somewhat on our side,” according to Altemus. Odysseus, a near-identical Intuitive Machines lander that became the first privately owned spacecraft to reach the Moon’s surface last year, shared a similar fate when it toppled over during its own landing. Athena touched down just a few days after the Blue Ghost private lander created by Firefly Aerospace, which landed “in an upright, stable configuration” on March 2nd.



The IM-2 mission is part of Intuitive Machines’ partnership with NASA to help return future crewed missions to the Moon. Athena was launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on February 26th, and carries 11 payloads and scientific instruments designed to find evidence of water on the lunar surface.

The Athena lander is charging on the surface according to Altemus and is communicating with the mission ground network team on Earth, but performance is sub-optimal, which may cut Athena’s ten-day lifespan short. “We have done some power conservation steps as prudent measures to see how long and what objectives we can accomplish in the mission going forward,” said Altemus. “It will be off-nominal, because we’re not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications.”

Once the orientation of the lander is confirmed, the IM-2 team can then establish how many of Athena’s payloads and scientific instruments are fully operational — including a drill designed to search for ice, and a hopping drone vehicle named Grace that aims to explore a permanently shadowed crater for the first time."

Multiple people have posted on the Google Pixel subreddit complaining about the change, with one user describing it as a “hollow feeling” vibration with “less thunk” post-update.

This wouldn’t be the first time Google has messed up haptics on Pixels. Back in 2022, an update weakened notification vibrations on Pixel 6 phones, before it was fixed about two months later.

Verge staffers have also noticed the change on Google Pixel 8 Pro devices. Whether it’s a bug or an intentional change is unknown, but it does not sound good. The change has also been seen on Pixel 7 and 7 Pro devices, but not on the Pixel 9 series, reports 9to5Google.


I just updated my own Pixel 8 Pro, and personally, the vibrations for a text message seem more intense when I place the device on a table. However, my experience with the haptics while typing is that it feels weaker, and selecting text feels like flicking a rubber band.

We don’t know if the latest change happened as part of the latest Android update or was part of a Feature Drop. We have reached out to Google about the issue and will update this article when we hear back.

Common sense usually tells them to let the artists do their thing in peace, but in the world of Apple TV Plus’s new comedy series The Studio, that sort of sound logic is in short supply.

From co-creators Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Peter Huyck, Alex Gregory, and Frida Perez, The Studio revolves around Matt Remick (Rogen), the freshly-promoted head of Continental Studios who sees his new gig as the opportunity of a lifetime. After years of working under Continental’s old boss Griffin Mill (Bryan Cranston), Matt, his assistant-turned-development exec Quinn Hackett (Chase Sui Wonders), and their colleague Sal Seperstein (Ike Barinholtz) think they’re finally getting a chance to really shape the studio’s future. That’s true to some extent, but none of them fully understand just how much more ridiculous life becomes when it’s your job to keep multiple teams with different priorities happy.

Matt himself seems to be the source of much of Continental’s woes in The Studio’s new trailer, which plays like a showcase of the series’ sizable cast of celebrity guest stars like Martin Scorsese, Greta Lee, and Ice Cube playing themselves. The trailer makes The Studio seem like it might have a lot in common with HBO’s recent series The Franchise, but hopefully the new show will pack a stronger comedic punch when it debuts on March 26th."

Similar to the aftermath from SpaceX’s failed seventh test flight on January 16th, yesterday’s explosion following the launch of Starship’s eighth test flight created another spectacle in the night sky as debris rained down over parts of the Caribbean causing flights to be delayed and diverted in Florida and Turks and Caicos Islands.

Following a successful launch, Starship separated from the Super Heavy booster rocket which returned to the launch pad and was captured by the launch tower for the third time. But during the upper stage’s ascent burn, “an energetic event in the aft portion of Starship resulted in the loss of several Raptor engines,” according to a statement SpaceX shared to its website last night. That caused Starship to lose attitude control and spin uncontrollably before exploding. SpaceX lost communications with the craft nine minutes and 30 seconds after the launch.

Full details about that “energetic event” aren’t yet known, but as with Starship’s last test flight, a self-destruct could have been potentially triggered as part of a pre-planned contingency response.

Following the explosion, the Federal Aviation Administration “issued ground stops for flights departing for Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Palm Beach airports for more than an hour before resuming normal operations at around 8PM ET,” according to Reuters. Operations at Tampa International Airport weren’t affected by the falling debris, but two flights headed to Miami were diverted to Tampa, while a flight headed to San Juan, Puerto Rico, had to return to TIA, according to KTLA.

Footage of Starship’s explosion, captured from Florida, was shared to X by Trevor Mahlmann. In the 30-second clip, a bright flash is followed by what appears to be an expanding, spiraling cloud in the dusk sky that eventually disperses and fades away."

As in its proposal last year, the DOJ says Google should be forced to sell its web browser, Google Chrome, and potentially Android, as punishment for being a monopolist, as Judge Mehta found last year, reports The New York Times.

In its new filing, the DOJ calls Google “an economic goliath” that it says “has denied users of a basic American value—the ability to choose in the marketplace.” To deal with that, “Google must divest the Chrome browser … to provide an opportunity for a new rival to operate a significant gateway to search the internet.” The department also still recommends that Google must change its Android business practices to enable competition or be ordered to sell the operating system. It dropped a suggestion that the company be allowed to sell Android in lieu of making the changes."
2025-03-09T20:00:03Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-08/trump-team-is-pivoting-to-no-pain-no-gain-as-economic-message/,"President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to cure what he said was an ailing US economy. Little more than a month into his second term, he’s starting to hint that the treatment might hurt.

The administration is still lavishing Americans with visions of a golden age to come. Yet in the course of a madcap week – which saw a flurry of tariffs and reversals, sparking a global trade war and a sharp stock-market decline – the tone changed a bit.

“There’ll be a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that,” Trump told Congress on Tuesday, defending his plans to throw up a protectionist barrier around the US with the biggest tariff increases in almost a century. By Friday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was arguing that the world’s biggest economy needed some “detox” to wean it off dependence on public spending.

As Trump barrels forward with his agenda, he’s facing some cold realities that didn’t look so troublesome not long ago. Inflation won’t be easy to quell, especially as the president is determined to pile on new tariffs even as he walks back some of the early ones. Consumers and investors are getting anxious, and the economy appears vulnerable to a slowdown.


A president who once measured his performance by the stock market is now brushing aside such worries. Hours before his address to Congress, the S&P 500 Index hit a post-election low as Trump’s threats of trade wars with Canada and Mexico turned into reality. It closed even lower on Friday. Treasury bonds declined on the week too, though a drop in oil prices – holding out hope for cheaper gasoline – was a brighter spot.

‘Not Even Looking’
Trump’s message is that any short-term pain will be worth it to bring manufacturing back to the country. “I’m not even looking at the market, because long term, the United States will be very strong with what’s happening here,” he said at the White House Thursday.

“It’s going to take an adjustment period for folks on Wall Street,” said EJ Antoni, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “The sky is not falling just because we implement tariffs.”


Bessent said earlier in the week that the administration’s focus was not on Wall Street, but on main street. There, the big economic data release of the week — Friday’s jobs report — offered a mixed picture. Payrolls increased by 151,000, solid enough, but a little below estimates, while unemployment ticked up to 4.1%.

Trump, who’s empowered Elon Musk with recommending job cuts in the federal bureaucracy, pointed to higher factory employment in the February report. “The labor market’s going to be fantastic, but it’s going to have high-paying manufacturing jobs, as opposed to government jobs,” the president said.

Kevin Hassett, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, said next steps in the administration’s economic program would push the gains further. “We’ve got to pass the tax cuts and get the deregulation train rolling,” he told Bloomberg Television on Friday. “We’re going to be reducing government employment and reducing government spending, and increasing manufacturing employment.”

Trade Uncertainty Soars to Highest on Record
Trump’s tariff threats have roiled markets and disrupted businesses

Still, there are plenty of signs that American industry — from small firms to giants like Ford Motor Co. — is worried about the trade war. That’s poised to escalate if trade partners retaliate, as they’re threatening to do, with their own duties that will hurt US exporters. The mounting uncertainty may not encourage hiring or investment.


Trump initially pledged tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China in February, but then deferred the ones on the US neighbors. This week, he let the deadline pass and imposed 25% duties on Canada and Mexico, before rushing to offer exemptions, first to the auto industry and then to all trade conducted under the USMCA deal he brokered in his first term. Trump also doubled the China tariff rate to 20%.

‘Probably Get Kicked Out’
Few industries face a bigger shift than autos, and their reprieve came after bosses from the Big Three carmakers appealed to Trump. But he only gave them a month to rearrange supply chains across North America that have been years in the making. What’s more, Trump warned further delays were unlikely, even though auto companies are about to get hammered by a wave of other measures, too.

Aides are downplaying hopes. “He really doesn’t like the word exemption,” Hassett told reporters Friday. “If I walk in and offer an exemption, then I’ll probably get kicked out of the office. We’ll see how it goes.”

Next up for the auto firms and other industries is the 25% charge on steel and aluminum that’s scheduled to begin March 12 and will rattle supply chains once again. April is when the most sweeping measures are supposed to take effect. One set is the so-called “reciprocal tariffs,” which the US will impose on all countries, at a rate deemed equivalent to their own trade barriers. The other will single out specific products, from automobiles and semiconductors to lumber and copper.

‘The Great Fleecing’
Trump’s frenzied trade campaign may be distracting Americans from other policies in the pipeline that will disproportionately help the wealthy, according to Heather Boushey, who served in the Biden administration on the Council of Economic Advisers. She cited Republican efforts to renew tax cuts and reduce the workforces and spending at government agencies.


“It is pure chaos and I worry every day that the chaos is aimed to distract us from the great fleecing of America,” Boushey said. “They have a very clear plan that will require cutting support for Medicaid and other really important programs.”

Alongside spending cuts, Trump is on the hunt for new revenues to offset tax cuts, and tariffs are part of the plan. “The president believes if we can replace income tax revenue with tariff revenue, we can make everybody better off,” Hassett said.

All this sets the stage for another showdown in a month’s time that will again test appetites – among consumers, businesses and investors — for a more wide-ranging trade war.

US Economic Data Hint at Softer Growth Ahead
Consumers are growing more pessimistic amid resurgent inflation


Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis, University of Michigan

Note: Consumer spending is adjusted for inflation

A Harris poll taken for Bloomberg News last month found that almost 60% of US adults expect Trump’s tariffs will lead to higher prices, and that 44% believe the levies are likely to be bad for the US economy. Tariffs also have come up a record 700 times during quarterly earnings calls for S&P 500 companies, according to a Bloomberg analysis of transcripts.

One thing that could dispel some of the mounting economic angst would be lower interest rates, but Federal Reserve officials have indicated they’re not likely to move for some time. They want more confirmation that inflation is on track to come down to their 2% goal – and more time to evaluate how Trump’s policies will affect the economy.

At a New York event on Friday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell — who’s been careful to remain noncommittal on that topic until more hard data comes in — said the economy was basically in good shape, but acknowledged “elevated levels of uncertainty,” especially around trade.

Powell’s description of what the Fed is doing right now may resonate for many Americans, after a roller coaster week. “As we parse the incoming information,” he said, “we are focused on separating the signal from the noise.”"

Chinese inflation figures released on Sunday pointed to stubborn weakness in demand as the world’s second-biggest economy struggles through a years-long property crisis. At the same time, President Donald Trump warned the US economy faces a “period of transition,” following market turmoil fueled by his trade policies.

Copper extended its slide from a four-month high, dropping 1.1% to $9,512 a ton by 9 a.m. local time on the London Metal Exchange. Aluminum and zinc also declined, while iron ore futures in Singapore slipped below $100 a ton.

“We’re dealing with four different groups, and a lot of people want it,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. He didn’t specify the contenders nor say which way he was leaning, instead saying “all four are good.”

ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok faces a deadline of April 5 to strike a deal for its US operations — or be banned from the country under a bipartisan law passed during the Biden administration. The US is by far its most important market — ByteDance operates a sister service, Douyin, at home in China — and TikTok US was estimated to be worth as much as $50 billion last year.

Last week, Trump said he would be open to extending the deadline again if necessary, but thought a deal was possible in the next month.He already pushed back the initial Jan. 19 date, averting a prolonged TikTok blackout, and has repeatedly signaled he’s open to striking a deal. As he’s tried to broker a sale, the president’s said he believes the US should be granted a 50% stake in the company as a condition.

Beijing-based ByteDance has not indicated any interest in selling off its US operations, though Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in December and attended the inauguration earlier this year. The company has made efforts to allay national security concerns among US lawmakers so as to be able to continue operating in the country.

Closely held ByteDance is now valued at more than $400 billion by key investors like SoftBank Group Corp. The company is buying back employee shares at a $312 billion valuation, showing confidence in an expansion strategy that includes a growing presence in ecommerce that leverages the popularity of its video platforms. That’s a big jump from just over a year ago, despite the uncertainty shrouding its prized US business.

China’s government would also need to approve any potential sale, and public pronouncements from Beijing have to date been unsupportive. Officials have been evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the service in the US, though the strong preference is for TikTok to remain wholly within ByteDance, Bloomberg News reported. Musk, who already owns the X social network, has said he’s not interested.

The public bidders to date include a group led by billionaire Frank McCourt and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, another featuring tech entrepreneur Jesse Tinsley and YouTube star MrBeast, and a merger offer by San Francisco-based Perplexity AI. Trump has also floated Oracle Corp. founder Larry Ellison’s name and TikTok has worked with Oracle on the hosting of its US users’ data."

San Diego-based Illumina is lowering its 2025 guidance to $4.50 adjusted earnings per share, at the low end of the range of $4.50 to $4.65 a share given last month, Chief Financial Officer Ankur Dhingra told The Wall Street Journal on Monday. 

The company expects to make the $100 million in cost cuts this year. 

The moves will help the company offset the impact from China sanctions, Dhingra said. “We will protect our earnings, and we have the levers and the actions to protect our earnings,” Dhingra said.

Illumina is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of genetic-sequencing machines and the chemicals the machines use. The company has been caught up in the tariff fight between the U.S. and China.

After President Trump imposed an extra 10% tariff on China exports last month, Beijing added Illumina to a list of “unreliable entities” that China considers untrustworthy or a risk to its security. 

Then last week, China’s government retaliated against the White House’s latest 10% added tariff on all Chinese imports by barring imports of Illumina gene sequencers.

The news has hurt Illumina shares, which have fallen nearly 36% this year to date. The stock on Monday closed down slightly at $85.97 a share.

“China is kind of signaling control, but we also understand this is kind of happening at the same time as the tariff negotiations are happening, too, so it may not entirely be about Illumina alone,” Dhingra said. 

He said the company has been in contact with both the Trump administration and China’s government. “We’re trying to navigate it well on both sides, and be able to keep working with the Chinese government,” he said.

China accounts for 7% of Illumina’s $4.3 billion in yearly revenue. Dhingra said Illumina is focused on its business outside of China and is making “significant progress” to realize the company’s goal of revenue growth in the high single-digit percentages by 2027.

The Chinese ban affects Illumina’s exports of sequencing machines to the country. 

Yet Illumina is still operating a facility in China that assembles its less advanced machines. Illumina will also keep exporting chemicals and other services to customers in China. 

Roughly 90% of Illumina’s revenue worldwide comes from chemical and services sales, Dhingra said.

2025-03-10T11:15:00Z,https://fortune.com/2025/03/10/deregulation-trump-risk-strategy/,"Day one of Donald Trump’s second presidency made it resoundingly clear: The Trump-Vance administration is prioritizing deregulation. He has announced a freeze on new federal regulations, an executive order requiring agencies to repeal at least 10 rules or regulations for each new one they adopt, and “initial rescissions” of 80-plus Biden actions, including easing rules around AI. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been taking charge of government agencies like the Treasury Department and reducing staff. And we’re less than two months in.

In organizations that have long felt the financial and administrative burdens of regulatory compliance, it’s only natural for board members and C-Suite leaders to regard this change with a collective sigh of relief. Less regulation means less budget and personnel allocated to auditing and compliance activities. But don’t start reallocating your compliance dollars yet. Many of the actions are already being challenged in court, and most regulations won’t be easy to do away with given the numerous requirements and time restraints it takes.

That won’t stop the administration from trying—and succeeding in many cases. The new administration will keep pushing to reduce existing federal oversight and issue fewer new regulations. We are moving into an era in which government regulation will be de-emphasized, whatever the eventual specifics.

Risk mitigation
There are two schools of thought among business leaders. One point of view is that this is exactly how risk management should work, reflecting the long-held notion among many business leaders that “governments that govern best govern least”—and in this context, regulate least. Nonprofits, along with environmental and consumer protection groups, see regulation as a positive development, fostering increased corporate social responsibility while helping to reduce overall risk in key areas (e.g., cybersecurity, fraud, climate change). The deregulators won at the ballot box, and we can anticipate a very different regulatory landscape as a result.

Regardless of which side you’re on, there is no question that deregulation actually makes your organization’s risk management strategy more important. Just because a compliance requirement disappears, it doesn’t mean the underlying risk does. It simply means it will be up to your organization to decide how to manage the risk. And the consequences of failure under deregulation can be much more dire than when regulation exists.

As history attests, government regulatory intervention is most often driven by the underlying risks. A series of high-profile financial reporting frauds and bankruptcies created a push to improve internal controls over financial reporting, eventually manifesting in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002. Risk management failures in the U.S. banking system spurred the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and subsequent recession, ultimately leading to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cited the rising prevalence of cybersecurity incidents, the potential for “systemic effects on the economy as a whole,” and recent AI developments that may exacerbate cybersecurity threats when enacting 2023’s SEC cybersecurity disclosure rules.

Rather than letting the market bear these risks—and stakeholders and citizens bear the consequences—the government sought to create regulations that would protect everyone. Whether their regulations are effective in doing so isn’t the point. The point is that the regulations are driven by the risks, and the intent of regulations is risk mitigation.

Fostering good habits
Government regulations, at their best, aim to instill good habits in the organizations they regulate. Metaphorically speaking, they make sure you eat your vegetables, drink your milk, wash your hands, and cultivate other habits that reduce risk while promoting health and safety. Many organizations haven’t had to think deeply about managing certain risks because the government was telling them what to do. Accordingly, increasing deregulation should force greater reflection: What are the real risks facing your organization, and how can you ensure you’re managing them effectively?


However, board members and C-suite leaders have an understandable tendency to assume that where no compliance requirements exist, organizations can afford to invest fewer resources. This may be true in some areas, such as environmental regulations, data protection, and cyber disclosure requirements.

But now is not the time to act fast on these assumptions. Before you take action to curtail or roll back the risk management and compliance investments your organization has made, you need a strategic plan to protect the company. This would start with purposeful conversations between the board and C-suite and their internal audit, risk management, infosec, and compliance teams. Questions leadership needs to ask include:

What inherent and residual risks does your organization face, even when compliance requirements have gone away? Are investments adequate to help the organization avoid, mitigate, or lean into those risks in the right ways?
How can freed-up resources be strategically redeployed?
How are risk and assurance teams monitoring changing regulations and shifting risks?
How will trade and tariff policies impact your supply chain and materials/goods costs?
How could the rollback of energy and environmental policies create longer-term risks for your organization (e.g., potential inflationary effects of lower energy prices, legal liabilities, international trade/policy challenges, investor/stakeholder pressures)?
Will immigration policies impact your industry/organization’s labor pool and costs?
An era of deregulation is both an imperative and an opportunity for organizations to look at the risks they face with fresh scrutiny. It’s also a chance to reassess risk management and oversight.

I’ve written a great deal about how the ongoing age of permacrisis mandates risk management transformation. Deregulation only ups the ante, putting the onus on your organization. Just because you don’t have to manage a risk doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. Make sure your organization’s key stakeholders maintain a strategic view of the road ahead.

2025-03-11T12:57:49Z,https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast/627536/mwc-2025-digg-reboot-vergecast,"The US smartphone market is pretty boring. There are iPhones, there are Galaxies, Google will happily give you a Pixel if you remember it exists, and that’s about it. But as soon as you get out and see the world a little, you realize: there are a lot of new ideas about smartphones out there.
On this episode of The Vergecast, we explore a few of those ideas. The Verge’s Allison Johnson and Dominic Preston join the show to talk about their trip to Barcelona for Mobile World Congress, the annual smartphone extravaganza. They saw phones that twist, phones that fold, phones with inexplicably enormous camera lenses attached, phones with lots and lots of AI, and phones with speakers so loud you’ll be ostracized from polite society. Now they’re back to tell the tale of interesting smartphones, and try to figure out if any of it might change our devices forever.

After that, we pivot to a new take on an old idea about social networks. Digg is back! Sort of. Right now, it’s a landing page and a waitlist, but an all-star roster of social veterans is serious about rebooting one of the internet’s first huge social hits. Kevin Rose and Justin Mezzell join the show to talk about why they’re bringing the platform back, how communities have changed online in the last two decades, why they think AI can make lives so much easier for moderators, and more.
Finally, we answer a question on the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about printers. More specifically: why won’t Apple, or anyone, make a good one? The answer seems to be pretty simple, but it’s also pretty disappointing. Don’t hold your breath for better printers.

2025-03-11T13:58:27Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/627566/mini-sphere-entertainment-vegas-immersive-venue,"Although original estimates set the cost of the Las Vegas Sphere at $1.2 billion, Sphere Entertainment eventually spent around $2.3 billion to build the interactive venue. As the company looks to expand to other cities, it’s also looking to scale down the venue, making it more affordable to build and operate.

Sphere Entertainment is currently working on a design for mini-Spheres with a capacity of about 5,000 people, the company’s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Dolan, told analysts during an investment call, according to a report by AV Magazine. The Las Vegas Sphere can seat 17,600 people, but attendance can be closer to 20,000 with standing capacity.

Smaller versions of the Sphere that require less property (and parking) would not only be much cheaper to build, they could potentially also attract a wider range of artists. Designing and producing the custom video content needed to fill the Las Vegas’ Sphere’s interior 160,000-square-foot LED screen requires a hefty investment from performers. So far the venue has hosted established bands like the Eagles, Phish, and U2, who enlisted the help of effects studio Industrial Light and Magic to help create the unique visuals for its Sphere show. Not every band has that kind of budget.


The mini-Spheres would still feature giant wraparound screens and provide similarly immersive experiences as the original venue. During its 40-show residency at the Sphere, U2 recorded one of its performances and created an immersive concert film that’s cheaper for fans than seeing the band live. Similar concert films could be screened at the mini-Spheres, providing more opportunities to recoup the cost of live performances, or be created as an alternative to artists performing live.

There’s no details on where or when the mini-Spheres would be built. The news follows an announcement from the company last October that it plans to build a second full-sized Sphere in Abu Dhabi."
2025-03-11T16:57:02Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/627665/x-musk-media-matters-lawsuit-damages,"The nonprofit Media Matters for America filed suit against X this week, accusing Elon Musk’s social media company of “harassment” and Musk of a “globetrotting litigation campaign against Media Matters.”

After Media Matters reported on X placing ads next to pro-Nazi content in 2023, X filed three lawsuits against the nonprofit accusing it of threatening the company’s relationships with advertisers. Media Matters now alleges that X breached its own Terms of Service by filing those suits in Texas, Ireland, and Singapore — claiming any complaints should have been brought to San Francisco, where X was headquartered at the time.

The media watchdog group says it has spent millions of dollars to defend itself in court, and is suing for damages. It’s also seeking a court order to stop X from initiating litigation in countries outside of the US or from pursuing its pending cases in Ireland and Singapore.


Media Matters now alleges that X breached its own Terms of Service

Media Matter’s complaint cites X’s own policy, which said that “all disputes related to these Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco County, California, United States.”

X changed its terms of service last year, however, to send disputes to federal court in the Northern District of Texas, Reuters reports. Musk moved the company’s offices from California to Texas last year after taking control of Twitter and rebranding it as X. A federal judge in Texas, who owned Tesla stock, denied a motion last year to toss out X’s lawsuit against Media Matters there — saying it X “properly pled its claims” in the correct venue.

San Francisco, meanwhile, has been a more favorable arena for watchdog groups sued by X. A federal judge there dismissed a similar lawsuit X filed against the Center for Counting Digital Hate (CCDH). In that suit, X accused CCDH of launching “a scare campaign” that allegedly cost it “tens of millions of dollars” in lost ad revenue. “This case is about punishing the Defendants [CCDH] for their speech,” the judge wrote in his decision.

X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Verge. The suit it filed against Media Matters in Texas claims the nonprofit “manipulated the algorithms governing the user experience on X to bypass safeguards and create images of X’s largest advertisers’ paid posts adjacent to racist, incendiary content.”

Media Matters stands by its analysis. “X brought these suits as punishment for Media Matters’ truthful reporting that ads appeared next to white-supremacist content on the X platform,” the organization says in the complaint filed Monday in a US District Court in San Francisco."
2025-03-11T18:04:18Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/627746/doge-elon-musk-records-request-foia,"Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) must comply with a request to disclose its internal records. In a ruling on Monday, US District Court Judge Christopher R. Cooper wrote that DOGE is likely covered by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), adding that “the public would be irreparably harmed by an indefinite delay in unearthing the records.”

The ruling stems from a lawsuit from an ethics watchdog group — the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) — that sued DOGE for failing to hand over documents related to communications between staffers and federal agencies, organizational charts, financial disclosures, and other records.

In his decision, Cooper takes into account the “unusual secrecy” DOGE has operated under, as it hasn’t named its members and reportedly uses the encrypted messaging app Signal for communications. He added that DOGE staffers “are reported to have joined the federal government only recently and, to put it charitably, may not be steeped in its document retention policies.”


RelatedElon Musk doesn’t work for DOGE
Judge Cooper has ordered DOGE and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to produce the documents requested by CREW “on an expedited basis.” He concluded that DOGE is “likely exercising substantial independent authority” compared to other agencies, likely making it subject to FOIA.

As reported by The New York Times, the Trump administration previously attempted to classify DOGE as a presidential records entity, which would allow it to skirt public records requests.

“Despite efforts and claims to the contrary, the government cannot hide the actions of the US DOGE Service,” Donald Sherman, CREW’s executive director and chief counsel, said in a response to the ruling. “We look forward to the expedited processing of our requests and making all the DOGE documents public.”"
2025-03-11T18:05:28Z,https://www.theverge.com/politics/627724/cfpb-adam-martinez-testimony-doge,"“Big time” confusion has wracked the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) staff since last month, the agency’s chief operating officer, Adam Martinez, testified before a federal judge in Washington, DC, on Monday.

Martinez’s testimony — which will continue on Tuesday afternoon — is meant to address questions around what’s happening at the financial regulation agency, before a judge decides whether to grant a preliminary injunction to preserve agency data, funds, and staff. It clarified points of disagreement between Martinez and other CFPB staffers, who said in sworn declarations to the court that the agency has become far less operational than Martinez has portrayed, particularly since the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) got involved — with some functions effectively grinding to a halt.

Martinez described the last several weeks as typical for a presidential transition. He says the agency was in flux during DOGE’s first few weeks at the agency, and in a way, that’s not uncommon during a new administration. “DOGE came in with a very hard fist,” Martinez said, but there was “a change in posture” when acting CFPB director Russell Vought, who leads the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and his deputy, Mark Paoletta — who is working as chief legal officer at the CFPB — became more involved in the agency’s inner workings. Their arrival, Martinez said, made him feel as if “the adults were around the table.”

Judge Amy Berman Jackson appeared skeptical of these assertions, and the administration’s justification for a massive reduction-in-force (RIF) plan — which the government has temporarily agreed to pause while she’s making her decision. On Tuesday, she’ll hear opposing testimony from two federal employee witnesses for the union that brought the case: Matthew Pfaff, chief of staff for the CFPB’s Office of Consumer Response; and a federal employee going by the pseudonym Alex Doe, who attended meetings between the CFPB and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) about cuts to the agency.

Is the CFPB operating? Depends on who you ask

The CFPB supervises financial institutions and fields consumer complaints. It’s increasingly played a role in the tech industry’s ventures into digital payments, though a Republican-majority Congress is seeking to roll back some of that authority, which includes monitoring things like the Elon Musk-owned X’s payments project. But the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents CFPB staff, alleges Vought is violating the separation of powers by quietly shutting it down.

Jackson is attempting to determine whether Trump administration officials like Vought are preventing employees from carrying out work required by congressional statute. The answer, so far, depends on who you ask.

Martinez told the judge he doesn’t have direct insight into the on-the-ground status of many offices at the agency that fall outside of his purview, besides what’s been told to him and that his understanding of the Trump administration’s approach has changed over time. Even now, Martinez says, he’s still not sure what the Trump administration’s preferred “end state” of the agency looks like — whether that’s a drastically reduced workforce or a full dismantling, where some of CFPB’s tasks get distributed to other agencies.

The Trump administration aimed to trim up to nearly 1,200 of the 1,700 employees at the CFPB, Martinez testified, and the agency believed it needed to do so on a condensed timeframe due to President Donald Trump’s executive order about reshaping the federal workforce and Vought’s work stoppage order.

Jackson appeared dubious of the suggestion that Vought’s own stop-work order “became the emergency that justified a RIF.” She pressed Martinez’s glass-half-full view of the current state of affairs at the CFPB (not “normal, but we’re operating”) and his interpretation of early Trump administration messaging as fairly typical for a presidential transition. Jackson peppered him with questions: Is it typical to send an order to agency staff to stop all work? Is it typical to fire all probationary employees from the get-go of an administration? Is it typical to implement a RIF with limited notice before a new full-time director is even in place? No, Martinez testified.

While things are still not normal, Martinez painted a picture of slightly more stability. “I think there’s less confusion today. I think there’s hope,” he says. Whether CFPB staff should hold out hope for clearer directives from the Trump administration, or for the court to step in to straighten things out, remains to be seen."
2025-03-11T22:04:42Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/627896/trump-tesla-domestic-terrorism-elon-musk-white-house,"At a White House event where he promised to buy a Tesla, President Donald Trump says he’ll label violence at Tesla locations as domestic terrorism.

Over the past few weeks, protests against Tesla CEO and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk have escalated at Tesla locations. There have been reports of situations like gunshots at a Tesla dealership and vandalism aimed at Tesla.

Here’s what Trump said while standing next to Musk:


Questioner, off screen: Mr. President, talk to us about some of the violence that has been going around the country at dealerships. Some say they should be labeled domestic terrorists…

Trump: I will do that. I’ll do it. I’m going to stop them. We catch anybody doing it… because they’re harming a great American company.

“We already know who some of them are, we’re gonna catch them,” Trump said. “And they’re bad guys.”


A Bluesky account representing the Tesla Takedown movement says in response to the comments, “We are a nonviolent grassroots protest movement. We oppose violence and destruction of property. Peaceful protest on public property is not domestic terrorism. They are trying to intimidate us. We will not let them succeed.

The statement also says that “it’s ironic that Donald Trump wants to label our peaceful movement as domestic terrorism. This is the man who sent a violent crowd to Capitol Hill to steal an election he lost, then pardoned more than 1,600 rioters who were found guilty by juries of their peers of serious crimes against the United States of America.”"
2025-03-11T22:17:04Z,https://www.theverge.com/tesla/627894/tesla-stock-sales-protest-musk-trump-doge,"Tesla stock plunged 15 percent on Monday, its steepest drop in five years. The price is down over 50 percent since its December highs. Tesla owners, disgusted with Elon Musk’s slash-and-burn tactics for the Trump administration, are selling their vehicles at a big loss. And Tesla showrooms across the country are becoming magnets for large crowds of protesters who want to see the company fail spectacularly.

But at least Musk can still count on one guy to have his back.

“I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,” President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday. “Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???”

But it will probably take more than a Cybertruck in the presidential motorcade to make Tesla great again. It will take an actual commitment to more affordable electric vehicles. It will take a more serious and safer approach to driverless cars. And it may take a change of leadership to get the company back on track. Let’s run down the company’s problems.

Sales slump
Trump’s election last year sent Tesla’s stock price soaring, as investors rewarded Musk for making the right political bet. It hit a record high of $488 in mid-December; by early March, it had sunk to roughly $226.

The wipeout erased over $800 billion in market value, Tesla’s steepest drop in years. Musk’s own net worth took an over $100 billion hit. (But don’t worry: he’s still the richest man in the world.)

What happened? Setting Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) side quest and the resulting protests aside for a moment, the simplest explanation is that Tesla’s sales suck. The company produced 4 percent fewer cars in 2024 than it did the previous year. And its deliveries were essentially flat. Tesla earnings came in light, even with a Bitcoin boost.

Musk’s own net worth took an over $100 billion hit.

In California, Tesla’s biggest market in the US, its sales dropped almost 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 12 percent for the year. Coastal elites’ love affair with the brand has soured.

And it’s not just in the US. In February, Tesla’s sales were down 10 percent in Spain, 42 percent in Sweden, 45 percent in France, 48 percent in Norway and Denmark, 53 percent in Portugal, 55 percent in Italy, and a whopping 76 percent in Germany. Musk’s endorsement may have helped Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party place second in the recent election, but it doesn’t seem to have improved his company’s flagging sales in Europe — down 45 percent in January year over year.

In China, the world’s largest car market, Tesla is on a sustained losing streak. The company has been backsliding for the past five consecutive months on a year-on-year basis, according to data from the country’s Passenger Car Association. Some of this is likely related to a temporary factory suspension to accommodate the new Model Y Juniper assembly line, but rising competition from domestic automakers like BYD is putting increased pressure on Tesla.

And unlike BYD, Tesla doesn’t sell any hybrid vehicles. It has nothing to fall back on when consumers feel anxious about the future of electric vehicles.

An aging lineup
A frequent criticism you see about Tesla is that the company’s vehicle lineup is getting a little long in the tooth. The Model X turns 10 this year, while the Model S is pushing 15. Both vehicles have only received minor updates since their initial launch. (A Tesla executive promised a refresh later this year.)

The Model 3 and Model Y, which represent the bulk of the company’s automotive revenues, were both updated recently, but the lag in regular updates has opened a window of opportunity for Tesla’s competitors. Consumers interested in plug-in power suddenly have a wealth of choices as newer, more interesting EVs from Hyundai, Kia, Honda, and General Motors hit the market.

Meanwhile, Tesla’s only new model to be introduced in the last five years is the Cybertruck, which has been recalled seven times since its launch. Musk has said that frequent software updates obviate the need for a more regular cadence of model refreshes.

While Tesla sales dropped, sales of non-Tesla EVs continued to climb. Americans bought a record 1.3 million electric cars, an increase of 7.3 percent year over year, according to Cox Automotive’s Kelley Blue Book. EVs now claim 8.1 percent of the market in the US.

Americans aren’t souring on electric vehicles — they’re just over Tesla.

No affordable models
For years, Musk has been promising to make an affordable electric vehicle, likely priced at $25,000. He first mentioned it in a 2018 interview, saying, “A $25,000 car, that’s something we can do.” Then, in 2020, at the company’s first Battery Day event, he speculated that Tesla could eventually produce upward of 20 million of these vehicles in a year — or roughly twice the current production of Toyota, GM, or Volkswagen.

Musk has said the more affordable EV would be built on the company’s next-generation vehicle platform. But rather than prioritize a vehicle that investors took to calling the “Model 2,” he spent Tesla’s resources on the expensive, polarizing Cybertruck. And after some initial excitement, the truck has turned into a flop. Musk predicted that Tesla would eventually sell 500,000 Cybertrucks a year. Last year, the company only sold an estimated 40,000.

Americans aren’t souring on electric vehicles — they’re just over Tesla.

Musk has also actively gummed up the works for a cheaper Tesla vehicle. Last year, he reportedly canceled the company’s plans to build a low-cost electric vehicle in favor of going all in on a robotaxi. But after some pushback, he claimed that a cheaper Tesla was back on the menu — only now, the vehicles are expected to be built on the same platform as the Model 3 and Model Y. Now, investors are worried that this new vehicle will cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales rather than boost the company’s profits overall.

Meanwhile, Kia and Volkswagen have announced plans to actually produce affordable EVs. And China has cracked the code on budget-priced, highly affordable EVs. The BYD Seagull, for example, was the country’s bestselling vehicle last summer, with about 190 miles of range and a sticker price of around $10,000. Even with a 100 percent tariff, the Seagull would still sell for a price much cheaper than most US-made EVs.

Robotaxi blues
Of course, Musk doesn’t think Tesla even needs a $25,000 vehicle. The company’s future is in AI — specifically self-driving cars and humanoid robots. In October 2024, he undercut his company’s own guidance to make “affordable models” by commenting, “I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless. It would be silly. It would be completely at odds with what we believe.”

Musk now believes that Tesla is on the verge of solving autonomy. He’s claimed that fully autonomous vehicles are right around the corner for almost a decade now. “Optimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue,” he said during the most recent earnings call, referring to Tesla’s humanoid robots.

“I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless.”

But while Musk bloviates about robots, Waymo and others are operating real driverless cars on the road. The Alphabet-owned company just launched its first partnership with Uber in Austin, Texas — Tesla’s headquarters and the city where Musk has said he plans on launching his own robotaxi project this summer.

There’s little evidence that Tesla is on the cusp of delivering what Waymo has already done. The promise that all Tesla vehicles built after 2016 have the hardware necessary for full self-driving turned out to be totally false. Musk said the company would replace the onboard computers for vehicle owners who bought the FSD package, a process he admitted would be “painful.” Tesla has already been targeted with a class action lawsuit claiming the company lied about the capabilities of its vehicles.

The Elon of it all
And then there’s Elon. And DOGE. And the fascist salute. And the chainsaw. And everything else going on behind those dark sunglasses.

Musk’s antics have turned the Tesla brand toxic. Disillusioned owners are selling their vehicles at big losses. Others are swapping in badges from other vehicle brands or using desperate-sounding stickers to signal their dissatisfaction with the billionaire CEO.

And even more are protesting outside Tesla showrooms as part of a grassroots effort to oppose Musk’s takeover of the federal government, damage the company’s stock price, and maybe even slash the world’s richest man’s net worth.

Separately, there have been a growing number of reports of arson and vandalism at the company’s stores. Tesla charging stations have been set on fire. A showroom in Oregon was shot up. A woman was arrested in Colorado for throwing a Molotov cocktail at a Tesla location. Tesla vehicles have been defaced with swastikas and expletives. Four Cybertrucks were destroyed in a fire in Seattle. The rage is real.

Keep in mind, Tesla’s sales were already dropping before all these incidents occurred. The growing dissatisfaction has led some analysts to predict even more dire numbers for the company’s first quarter results this spring.

What’s next?
It’s unclear what can turn the company’s fortunes around. Some supporters have started to openly question whether Tesla can continue to survive with Musk at the helm. But shareholders aren’t likely to jettison the controversial CEO yet, especially after voting to approve his multibillion-dollar pay package last summer. The outcome was a huge vote of confidence in Musk’s leadership — and a big validator of his behavior.

But that was pre-DOGE, before the salute, and before the stock wipeout. Tesla’s board is clearly feeling the pinch. Chair Robyn Denholm and director James Murdoch (son of Rupert Murdoch) both sold millions of dollars’ worth of shares in the past month.

A lot rests on Musk’s promises of a cheaper Tesla, a next-generation vehicle platform, and an actual working robotaxi service. President Trump can buy all the Teslas he wants, but if Tesla’s future is built on a bunch of falsehoods and fantasies, it’s unlikely the company can emerge from this fire unscathed."
2025-03-11T22:50:04Z,https://www.theverge.com/news/627919/gail-slater-doj-antitrust-confirmation-vote,"The US Department of Justice antitrust division will be led by Gail Slater following a successful Congressional confirmation vote today. Slater will take over multiple antitrust cases against large tech firms, filed under both Donald Trump and Joe Biden — including a high-profile Google search monopoly suit.

The Senate voted to confirm Slater with bipartisan support as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division. She’ll be joining Trump’s administration for the second time — she worked for the National Economic Council during his first term and was an economic policy advisor and Senate staff member for Vice President JD Vance before the election. She has a long history in antitrust law, joining the Federal Trade Commission to work on merger cases starting in 2004 and later lobbying for anti-monopoly legislation while working for Roku. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-IA) urged colleagues to confirm Slater by noting her “several years” of private antitrust law practice and a decade-long stint at the FTC.

Trump’s DOJ still says Google should be broken up
The DOJ Antitrust Division isn’t afraid to go to court

Slater will join the administration in the middle of US v. Google, an antitrust case that saw Google declared an unlawful monopolist last year. A hearing scheduled next month will decide what remedies to enforce against it, including a potential breakup of the company. She will be replacing Jonathan Kanter, under whom the DOJ won its case against Google.

The new antitrust watchdog hasn’t firmly articulated when and where the DOJ will fight its new battles. When Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee, who leads the antitrust subcommittee, asked about her commitment to see through antitrust enforcement started under Trump, she said, “resources are of course a very important consideration” in taking cases further, adding that antitrust civil litigation is “costly so that will be a consideration.”

Other parts of the Trump administration have used their power to go after political enemies, and Trump’s long-standing antagonism with companies like Google has raised concerns of politically motivated litigation. Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, who has said she had heard good things about Slater, asked during the confirmation hearing whether she would “open an investigation or file a lawsuit for any reason other than legitimate law enforcement purposes.” Slater responded that she doesn’t “anticipate a fact pattern like you described.”"

He was on a mission to purchase a Tesla—a sop to his adviser Elon Musk, who happens to be the car company’s chief executive. Trump campaigned extensively against Biden’s electric vehicle mandates and in February moved to pause the construction of charging-station infrastructure.

The Tesla was “the most Democratic car make by a longshot,” according to a 2023 analysis of consumer data by Mike Shannon and Will Feltus published in Fortune magazine. Democratic strongholds of San Francisco, Denver, Honolulu and Los Angeles had the highest concentration of Tesla owners, they found. 

But the car got a GOP pitchman Tuesday at Trump’s photo-op, where several models were parked on the White House grounds for the president to inspect. Holding notes that detailed the price of each model, the president expounded on the virtues of Musk’s vehicles.

Others on the White House staff own Teslas, including communications director Steven Cheung, who confirmed that he owns a Model X.Trump’s event was an attempt at correcting what he sees as a wrong: Musk’s alignment with the Trump White House and his leading role in efforts to slash the size of the federal government are causing problems for the brand. Protesters have picketed Tesla showrooms across the country, and some liberals have boycotted the brand.

Tesla’s stock had its worst day since 2020 on Monday, tumbling 15%. The stock made up some ground Tuesday.

The scene at the White House was notable in other ways: It showed the most powerful man in the world lending support to the richest man in the world. Other presidents have used cars as props—though not to prop up the fortunes of their staff. 

As vice president, Joe Biden drove his beloved 1967 Corvette around government-controlled grounds for a segment with the comedian Jay Leno. “I like speed,” said Biden, grinning as he shifted gears. “I’ve always liked to drive.”

As president, Biden was more on message, driving an electric Ford F-150 to highlight support for EVs. “This sucker’s quick,” Biden said in May 2021 as he pulled up to a group of reporters, saying that he could imagine buying one of the vehicles. 

On Tuesday at the White House, a silver Cybertruck glistened in the sun for the president to inspect. But Trump folded his 6-foot-3-inch frame into a red Tesla sedan as Musk stood nearby. “Watch the Secret Service go crazy,” Trump said. 

“If you actually drove it around, it would really be wild,” Musk observed, and then entered the vehicle on the passenger side. 

“Wow. That’s beautiful,” Trump gushed as he appraised a computer panel near the steering wheel. He didn’t drive the car, but he said it was the one he would buy. Trump added that he hadn’t actually driven a car in a long time, though he repeatedly said he loves to drive. The president said that he planned to allow his staff to use the car. (A U.S. Secret Service official confirmed that presidents can only pilot their own vehicles in controlled and secure settings, which don’t include public roads.)

Though the event was designed as an infomercial of sorts for Tesla, there were limits to how far the president was willing to go. Upon learning that Musk is manufacturing a Tesla without a steering wheel, Trump said: “I’m going to pass on that.”

Musk acknowledged this week that his D.C. job is causing strain elsewhere. Asked by the Fox Business host Larry Kudlow about how he is managing to run his businesses while slashing the federal government, he deadpanned: “With great difficulty.” 

Trump, pressed Tuesday by a reporter about when Musk would depart government service, said the topic had been on his mind. “I think he’ll know when it’s time,” he said. 

Musk offered a diplomatic response: “I’ll stay as long as it’s useful and I’m productive.”

Trump, who frequently brags about his prowess as a negotiator, said he wasn’t looking for a deal on a Tesla. “I’m president,” he said, “so I want to pay full price.”"

Chinese authorities summoned Walmart officials for a dressing-down this week after receiving complaints that the retailer was pressuring some Chinese suppliers to cut prices to absorb the cost of U.S. tariffs, state media and people familiar with the matter said Wednesday.

The president’s decision to add a 20% tariff on Chinese imports on top of previous tariffs has put U.S. retailers such as Walmart in a tough spot. Raising prices risks the ire of Trump and American consumers, but getting suppliers to bear the burden isn’t simple either. 

China, too, is under pressure as tariffs inflict pain on its export-focused economy, which is grappling with overproduction and weak demand at home. U.S. businesses have been reducing their dependence on China in response to worsening relations, a trend that developed during Trump’s first term and has accelerated since.

Many companies are shifting production to Southeast Asia and elsewhere. For sensitive high-tech goods, some U.S. companies are already pursuing an “anything but China” strategy.

In recent weeks, Walmart and other U.S. retailers have told some suppliers they want discounts on China-made products, according to industry executives. Some suppliers have also been asked to move production outside of China, they say.
That was the backdrop for Tuesday’s meeting in Beijing, where Chinese officials asked Walmart representatives to explain what the company was doing, according to people familiar with the meeting. The officials said making Chinese suppliers pay the costs of tariffs would be irresponsible and unfair. 

There was also a veiled threat: The Chinese side told Walmart that asking suppliers to lower prices might violate contracts and disrupt market order, and the officials referred to potential legal consequences, the people said. 

“If Walmart insists” on making Chinese suppliers absorb the blow, “then what awaits Walmart is not just talk,” state broadcaster China Central Television said on social media Wednesday.

Walmart said it is in discussions with suppliers to help consumers save money and it will continue to work closely with suppliers “to find the best way forward during these uncertain times.”

At the Tuesday meeting, Walmart representatives said they would work with Chinese suppliers to find ways to avoid damaging the interests of the parties involved, the people familiar with the meeting said. Walmart also said China was one of its most important markets and the company believed China’s supply chains were key to its global success, the people said.

Walmart executives have said they expect to be able to manage tariffs well, despite uncertainties.

“We’re wired to try and save people money. So that will be our ultimate goal,” Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on an earnings call last month.Negotiations between U.S. retailers and suppliers are becoming more difficult as tariffs increase, some manufacturers say, because many suppliers of low-cost items are already operating on razor-thin profit margins. Retail behemoths such as Walmart can use their size to drive down prices.

The China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Textiles, a state-backed industry group, said Wednesday it had received reports from some members about large U.S. retailers asking them to cut prices. The group said it would defend Chinese companies’ interests.

In another implied threat, the Chinese officials told Walmart that Chinese consumers who shop at Walmart stores could easily find alternatives, the people familiar with the meeting said. Walmart operates more than 300 Walmart and Sam’s Club stores in China.
The country accounts for a small but growing piece of Walmart’s sales. Walmart reported about $5 billion of net sales in China in its latest quarter, up 28% from a year earlier. That was less than 3% of its global total revenue for the period.

Exports are one of the main growth drivers in China’s economy. In an early indication that higher tariffs are starting to take a toll, China reported export growth for the first two months of the year moderated from December.

China has retaliated against the U.S. by adding tariffs on American goods, including farm products such as soybeans.

Tariffs are paid by importers in the U.S., but suppliers can take on the cost for importers by lowering prices. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said China will “eat any tariffs.” Economists have largely found that the cost of tariffs is borne by U.S. customers."

2025-03-13 10:30:00+00:00,https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trump-tariffs-eu-wine-champagne-0b4bd98d?mod=finance_lead_pos1,"President Trump on Thursday announced another salvo in a fast-escalating trade war with the European Union, saying he would impose a 200% tariff on U.S. imports of wine, Champagne and other alcoholic beverages from the 27-nation bloc.

The tariff threat, Trump said, came in response to the EU’s decision to impose a 50% levy on American whiskey—itself a response to 25% steel and aluminum tariffs that Trump imposed this week.

The EU, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform, put a “nasty 50% Tariff on Whisky,” adding that if that duty isn’t removed, “the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES.”

The tit-for-tat over alcoholic beverages, which pushed down shares in European drinks companies, could target more than $10 billion worth of European exports to the U.S. depending on how broadly Trump imposes tariffs. In 2024, the U.S. imported roughly $5.4 billion of wine from the EU, which includes about $1.7 billion in sparkling wines, according to Census Bureau data. It also imported more than $1 billion of beer and more than $3.5 billion of spirits such as vodka, gin and whiskey.

“Donald Trump is escalating the trade war he chose to unleash,” French Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin wrote in a post on X. “France remains determined to retaliate together with the European Commission and our partners.”

An EU spokesman said the bloc had no immediate comment on Trump’s threat to put 200% tariffs on EU Champagne and other alcohol.

EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič reached out to Trump administration officials immediately after Brussels announced its countertariffs on Wednesday, and arrangements are being made for calls between the two sides, the EU spokesman said. 

“We are prepared for whatever might come,” spokesman Olof Gill said Thursday, before Trump’s announcement. “We deeply regret the introduction of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports yesterday, and we would feel the very same about any future measures.”

The S&P 500 suffered its first correction since October 2023, down more than 10% from its Feb. 19 record high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the Dow industrials also fell.

President Trump threatened to impose 200% tariffs on alcohol imports from the European Union after the bloc hit back at his levies on steel and aluminum imports.

Even if those threats don’t pan out or if tariffs on Canada and Mexico are eventually rolled back, the “pattern of announcements and imposition of tariffs in fairly rapid fashion is unsettling the markets,” said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede.

Investors eyed an inflation gauge that showed wholesale prices held steady in February—although prices charged for eggs soared. Inflation concerns have intensified as Trump’s import levies risk fueling price pressures, while also weighing on growth.

Meanwhile, Russia rejected a U.S.-brokered plan for a ceasefire in Ukraine, saying the proposed 30-day truce would help Kyiv regroup.

Putin said any pause in fighting at this point would be in Ukraine’s interest because Russia is gaining on the battlefield, and a host of issues would need to be resolved before a cease-fire could be reached.

“The idea itself is good, and we of course support it, but there are questions we have to discuss,” Putin said, referring to a proposed 30-day cease-fire in the war, adding that Russia sought a lasting peace that would need to eliminate the “root causes” of the conflict.

The comments were the first official response from Moscow after Ukraine agreed this week to a U.S.-backed proposal for a pause in the war, now in its fourth year. Putin spoke as President Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, was due in Moscow to discuss the cease-fire proposal, according to two U.S. officials.

Trump said Thursday he planned to speak with Putin soon and he was pressing for a speedy end to the conflict.

“I’d love to meet with him and talk to him, but we have to get it over with fast,” Trump said, sitting next to NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte. Asked about the continuing talks with Russia, Trump said they were “very serious” and added: “Hopefully they’ll do the right thing.”"
2025-03-13T10:00:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/chips-race-spews-forever-chemicals-as-startups-emerge-to-destroy-them,"The battle for artificial intelligence supremacy hinges on microchips. But the semiconductor sector that produces them has a dirty secret: It’s a major source of chemicals linked to cancer and other health problems.

Global chip sales surged more than 19% to roughly $628 billion last year, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association, which forecasts double-digit growth again in 2025. That’s adding urgency to reducing the impacts of so-called “forever chemicals” — which are also used to make firefighting foam, nonstick pans, raincoats and other everyday items — as are regulators in the US and Europe who are beginning to enforce pollution limits for municipal water supplies. In response to this growing demand, a wave of startups are offering potential solutions that won’t cut the chemicals out of the supply chain but can destroy them.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, have been detected in every corner of the planet from rainwater in the Himalayas to whales off the Faroe Islands and in the blood of almost every human tested. Known as forever chemicals because the properties that make them so useful also make them persistent in the environment, scientists have increasingly linked PFAS to health issues including obesity, infertility and cancer.

“There is an urgent need to prevent any further industrial PFAS pollution and clean up existing contamination,” said Lee Bell, technical and policy advisor for the International Pollutants Elimination Network, a global nonprofit network. Incineration won’t destroy the chemicals, he said, “so we need to identify new technologies to meet this challenge.”

Among the companies tackling PFAS is Switzerland-based Oxyle AG. The company’s modular system can be scaled to treat everything from groundwater to industrial wastewater. It works by generating bubbles less than 1 millimeter in diameter — smaller than a grain of salt — in water contaminated with PFAS. Those bubbles help grab PFAS molecules and are processed in a way that helps break down the chemicals into its harmless mineral constituents like carbon dioxide and fluorides. The process leaves no toxic byproducts, according to the company.

The technology can remove more PFAS than conventional filtration approaches. Oxyle said it can reduce some PFAS concentrations from more than 8,700 parts per trillion (ppt) to below 14 ppt, representing a more than 99% elimination rate. That lower concentration is around the detection limit for the six compounds Oxyle tested for, and the startup emphasized it can further reduce PFAS levels by extending treatment or adjusting the amount of catalyst used.

Although the US and European Union are beginning to limit the amount of PFAS allowed in drinking water, there are still few restrictions on what companies can release, according to Lenny Siegel, executive director of the California-based Center for Public Environmental Oversight. Siegel, who has focused on tech sector pollution for decades, said he’s unaware of any US fab plant that faces restrictions on PFAS they can release in their wastewater.

Testing data from one US semiconductor plant showed as much as 623 ppt of PFAS in wastewater, according to a 2021 study. New US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) drinking water guidelines for two types of forever chemical limit concentrations to 4 ppt — the lowest “feasible” level, the agency said last year. It emphasized there is no level of exposure without risk of health impacts. (Those rules have been challenged in court, and the cases are on pause at the request of President Donald Trump’s EPA.)

Conventional water treatment at municipal plants typically involves adding chemicals like aluminum or ferrous sulfates to help bind together dirt and other small particles. Because solids are heavier than water they settle at the bottom and can be separated. The water typically goes through additional filtration systems before it reaches the end user. But this approach wasn’t designed to capture PFAS.

“If you want to make an actual impact which is scalable and affordable, you need to decentralize the treatment. You need to go close to the source of the problem,” said Oxyle Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Fajer Mushtaq. “Treating drinking water is way too late, too expensive and too slow.”

The chips industry can “lead the charge in solving the issue because they have the opportunity to work on their waters in a very controlled environment,” said Steven Lam, head of technology at Gradiant Corp. The Boston area-based company launched a treatment technology last year that it says permanently removes and destroys PFAS and has several ongoing demonstration projects, including with semiconductor manufacturers.

The biggest barrier to widespread adoption of new PFAS destruction technology is regulatory uncertainty. PFAS limits for drinking water and wastewater in many jurisdictions are evolving with varying standards. It’s crucial that regulators understand the public health benefits of technologies that completely destroy the chemicals over ones that can’t, Gradiant said in a statement.

Although some industries like apparel are phasing out PFAS and swapping in less-dangerous alternatives, for the chips industry, the chemicals remain crucial. SEMI, an industry association for the semiconductor supply chain, said while transitioning from PFAS is necessary, “a lack of proven substitutes means advanced semiconductors cannot be manufactured without them.” The group added that the sector has “actively established partnerships with governments and academia” to research and develop solutions.

The chips sector is an important future market for Oxyle, and the company is in early-stage discussions with several firms, said Mushtaq. Currently, though, it doesn’t have active projects in the industry and is focused on groundwater cleanup and industrial applications in Europe.

“What we need today is not to say we want to ban PFAS in the semiconductor industry. It's a pipe dream, it's not going to happen,” she said. “What we need is better waste management.”"
2025-03-13T10:00:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/deep-pocketed-meituan-looks-to-build-on-its-hong-kong-victory,"Simon Miao, a Hong Kong resident, signed up for a food-delivery subscription with Deliveroo during the pandemic, but he later canceled it because the monthly fee, which tops out at HK$98 ($12.61), didn’t bring many perks.

Now he’s hooked on a rival service called Keeta from the Chinese delivery giant Meituan. It offered broader restaurant options, generous discounts and free delivery when the platform was first launched. He said he won’t use anything else.

This week, Deliveroo said it was losing too much money in Hong Kong and called it quits after a decade of operating in the city. The retreat marks the first casualty of Keeta’s aggressive pricing tactics, subsidized by parent Meituan, which has a market value of about $130 billion.

As the Chinese super app expands further afield, it’s deploying similar tactics in other new markets. The company launched in Saudi Arabia last September and has been attacking the market through similar measures. It reached one million weekly active users in January, according to Sensor Tower data, matching Delivery Hero’s Hungerstation.


Keeta Drones, a subsidiary of Meituan, received an operation license in the United Arab Emirates late last year, and the Chinese company’s ambition goes far beyond the two largest economies in the Gulf.

According to Chinese media outlet LatePost, Keeta plans to expand to Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain in the next three years. The company plans to build its overseas presence into a hundred-billion dollar business, the news site said, citing people familiar with the plans who it didn’t name. To vie for market share in Saudi Arabia, the company has set no upper limit on investment.

Meituan, founded in 2010, initially built a business model with discount offerings like Groupon. In 2013, the company expanded into food delivery, and has since grown into the largest player anywhere. It clocked a gross transaction value of €136 billion ($148 billion) last year, almost double that of Uber Eats’s (€71 billion) and Doordash’s (€74 billion), according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report.

Keeta’s ambition points to a wider woe in the food delivery industry: after years of growth-at-all-cost expansion during the Covid-19 pandemic, fueled by cheap interest rates, investors are asking companies to turn a profit. But price wars spurred on by rivals with deeper pockets has made it difficult for smaller players to fight back. Last month, after years of sluggish sales, Just Eat Takeaway.com NV struck a deal to sell itself to Prosus NV for €4.1 billion.

The rapid rise of Keeta puts Delivery Hero — the German food delivery company that competes with the Chinese app in both Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia — in a precarious position after achieving positive free cash flow for the first time in late 2023.

Foodpanda, Delivery Hero’s subsidiary in Hong Kong, had dominated the market for years. But shortly after Keeta arrived, it swiftly became the largest player by gross sales volume in both food and grocery delivery in the second half of 2024, according to Measurable AI, an analytics firm that tracks receipts.


Keeta’s price war went beyond coupons and cheap delivery, it also went after the riders.

Ellery Li, a graduate student in Hong Kong, said in an interview with Bloomberg that he signed up to deliver food part time because a courier could receive as much as HK$50 per order, a much more lucrative salary than on other platforms.

“Meituan’s Chinese base can easily continue to finance the expansion of international unit Keeta over the coming years,” Clément Genelot, an analyst at Bryan Garnier said.

A representative for Meituan declined to comment.

Niklas Östberg, the chief executive officer of Delivery Hero, told Bloomberg in an recent interview that the initial public offering of Talabat, its Middle East subsidiary which created a $2 billion cash windfall, would put the company in a stronger position to “not be taken advantage of” by its competitors.

“You can face off Meituan without finding a bigger parent company as long as you’re profitable and cash-generative,” Genelot said. That “is the case of Delivery Hero in the Middle East.”

The rise of Keeta outside of China has echoes of Temu, the Chinese e-commerce site which sells £1 milk frother and £5 wireless headphones.

Temu, also heavily subsidized by its parent company PDD Holdings Inc., a $160 billion online retail giant, has been a destructive force in Europe and the US. The Chinese platform spent aggressively on subsidies and advertising when it first landed, including millions of dollars on Super Bowl commercials. It soon became one of the world’s largest online discount stores, taking on market share from existing giants Amazon and Walmart, and eBay."
2025-03-13T10:00:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/cibc-names-harry-culham-as-next-ceo-after-long-rise-from-intern,"Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce appointed Harry Culham to succeed Chief Executive Officer Victor Dodig, who will retire in November after leading the nation’s fifth-largest lender for more than a decade.

Culham, a former intern in CIBC’s Vancouver office who now leads its capital-markets arm, will become chief operating officer on April 1, the bank said Thursday in a statement. After handing the reins to Culham on Nov. 1, Dodig will remain as an adviser to the new CEO and the board through April 2026.

Dodig, 59, who invested in technology upgrades and spent years transforming the bank to focus more on client relationships, said it’s never the perfect time to leave.

“At a personal level, by the end of this, it’ll be more than 11 years,” he said in an interview. “We’re really coming into our own in terms of what’s been achieved.”

The transition will cap more than two decades at the bank for Dodig, who became CEO in 2014. And after weathering years of investor frustration over its underperforming stock, amid concerns over CIBC’s exposure to US office loans, his pending departure comes at a relative high point.

CIBC has worked through the credit woes, kept a tight grip on expenses, targeted wealthy Canadian clients and focused on private companies south of the border. Its stock had been on a tear, returning more than 50% in the 12 months through January, before US President Donald Trump’s trade war upended global markets. The shares have dropped 12% since.


“When you’re in the seat here as captain for over a decade, you don’t cling on to the role,” Dodig said. “It feels great because Harry’s a great partner.”

Culham, who has been part of the bank’s executive team since 2015, said he doesn’t foresee making any “major pivots” when he takes over.

“There’s a lot more upside on the execution of our strategy,” he said in the interview, noting that he has already been leading enterprise strategy and corporate development for several years.

Culham is one of several CIBC executives who were deemed possible CEO contenders as the bank has shuffled its top leaders over the past year and a half, moves it said were intended to give senior managers new experience. Culham himself added oversight of global asset management to his purview in September.

After taking part in one of CIBC’s first graduate programs, Culham went on to other banking roles in Europe and Asia. He rejoined the Canadian bank in 2008 and took over as head of the capital-markets division in 2015. He also oversees its Caribbean business.

During Dodig’s tenure, CIBC acquired Costco Wholesale Corp.’s Canadian credit-card portfolio, built a new office tower for its downtown Toronto headquarters and bought Chicago-based PrivateBancorp Inc. in 2017.

The firm now generates about 20% of its profit in the US, Dodig said, up from less than 2% a decade ago, but it’s focused on wealth management and commercial lending, rather than a broad-based retail banking strategy. That contrasts with rival Toronto-Dominion Bank, which is the 10th-largest lender in the US but now faces growth restrictions after its anti-money-laundering settlement.

Dodig started his career as a CIBC bank teller in 1985, he said. He, too, left the bank for many years — he was a management consultant at McKinsey & Co. and also worked for UBS Group AG and Merrill Lynch — before rejoining CIBC in 2008.

2025-03-13T10:00:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/new-york-shopping-trips-by-canadians-dwindle-over-trump-s-taunts,"For years, Canadians from southern Ontario have made the short drive across the border to Buffalo, New York, to load up on cheap milk and shop at retailers like Target and Trader Joe’s that they don’t have access to at home.

But those trips have been happening less often since President Donald Trump took office and began threatening tariffs and disparaging Canada, even saying that the country should become the 51st US state.

Vehicle and truck crossings at the US-Canadian border in western New York are down 13% this year as fewer Canadians make the trip, said Mark Poloncarz, who runs Erie County, which includes Buffalo. The county’s initial sales tax receipts have slipped 7% through mid-February, a $4.9 million reduction in revenue. Poloncarz blames the decline at least partly on a drop in Canadian visitors.

“We are now starting to see the negative impact of tariffs in western New York,” said Poloncarz, a Democrat who has served as Erie’s county executive since 2012. “No one wins in a trade war between the United States and Canada.”

The pain in the Buffalo area exemplifies a broader fraying of the deep economic ties that have long united the two countries. In some cases, Canadians are even selling US properties and moving back home. The US is poised to lose about 3 million Canadian visitors this year, a 15% drop that will translate into $3.3 billion of lost spending, according to Tourism Economics.

“The setback will be large enough to affect profits and seasonal hiring in destinations that count most heavily on Canadian travelers,” said Adam Sacks, president of Tourism Economics, a unit of Oxford Economics.

The travel effect is unfolding against a backdrop of an intensifying trade war that’s roiling ties between longtime allies. Canada announced new 25% tariffs on about C$30 billion ($20.8 billion) of US-made products on Wednesday, including steel and aluminum, striking back after Trump went ahead with global duties on imports of those metals.

During a press conference on Thursday, Trump ruled out easing the penalties on Canada. “We’ve been ripped off for years, and we’re not going to be ripped off anymore. No, I’m not going to bend at all — aluminum, or steel, or cars.” He also reiterated his claim that Canada “only works as a state. We don’t need anything it has.”

For the US tourism industry, the latest blow came earlier with the revelation this week that the Trump administration is preparing a tougher new travel rule for Canadians, who typically make up the largest group of international visitors to the US. The regulation would require them to register their information with the US government and submit to fingerprinting if they cross by land and plan to stay longer than 30 days.

That would potentially affect many Canadian snowbirds, retirees who spend the winter in warmer US states such as Florida and Arizona. In total, about 20 million Canadians visited the US in 2024, spending $20.5 billion and propping up 140,000 jobs, the US Travel Association estimates.

Canceling Disneyland
Already this year, Canadian visitors traveling by car fell 23% in February to 1.2 million, the second straight month of year-over-year declines, according to Statistics Canada. Another drag is coming from the Canadian dollar, which has fallen about 6.1% against the US dollar during the past year.

Some would-be travelers, including British Columbia Premier David Eby, have canceled trips. Eby said he had to break the news to his children that their spring vacation to California’s Disneyland theme park was off, even after spending C$1,000 on tickets. He’s been urging residents to avoid US travel if possible.

“We are starting to see groups that typically have trips planned saying, ‘You know, we are going to stay in Canada,’” said Fred Ferguson, chief executive officer of the American Bus Association.

At first, many tourists were only avoiding Republican states but now many are skipping all US travel, said Laura Mezzacapo, accounting manager at Vancouver-based The Travel Group, a travel agency.

Ahead of a payment deadline at the end of March, a group of more than 20 travelers backed out of a trip to Santa Fe, New Mexico, saying they were holding off on visiting the US for now, Mezzacapo said. Each client got a C$700 deposit back and avoided paying the trip fee of between C$4,500 and C$6,000.

Santa Fe is one of Travel Group’s most popular destinations due to its arts and wellness scene. But the agency is no longer promoting that city or any other US trips on its social media, marketing or advertising campaigns.


“We won’t promote Santa Fe until everyone feels it’s OK to travel again,” Mezzacapo said.

Shifting Opinions
Contributing to the decline is a change in attitudes.

In a survey released last month, polling firm Leger found that almost half of Canadian travelers said they were less likely to visit the US in 2025 compared with last year, a response that was particularly prevalent among people over 55 and higher-income households. Only 10% of respondents said they were more likely to visit the US, with 43% reporting no change in their intentions.

In a subsequent poll, Leger found signs of a broader breakdown. According to that survey, most Canadians have reduced their purchases of US goods and 30% said they considered the US an enemy country. By comparison, 31% said they considered the US an ally.

Still, after years of largely seamless North American integration, many Canadians are hesitant to turn away from the US even as they grit their teeth at recent White House policies.

While Trump’s tariffs and his talk of the 51st state offend many Canadian snowbirds, there’s little evidence they’re leaving en masse, said Gwendal Gauthier, publisher of Le Courrier des Ameriques, a monthly newspaper that targets French-speaking Canadians in South Florida. He said he has no trouble distributing 50,000 copies of the free publication.

“The Canadians don’t like what is happening, but they are not running away from Florida,” said Gauthier, who also administers a 98,000-member Facebook group called Les Snowbirds Quebecois en Floride. “There is no panic.”

But there is anger.

Constance Bonneville said she decided to leave the US after Trump’s election in November, citing his anti-LGBTQ stances and trade policies with Canada. She put her house up for sale in Scottsdale, Arizona, and left her career as a real estate agent after more than 10 years in the US.


“The vibe for me is, I’m out of here,” she said.

Now that she’s in British Columbia, she said Trump’s escalating trade war “made me realize how much of a right decision I made about being on this side of the border. Canadians are very united, and we’re taking measures to protect ourselves against the United States of America. I mean, that’s crazy.”

2025-03-13T10:05:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/blackrock-investors-pump-funds-into-struggling-aggregator-razor,"Investors including BlackRock Inc. have agreed to provide another loan of at least $15 million to Razor Group, according to people familiar with the matter, as the German e-commerce brand aggregator attempts to stave off a liquidity crunch.

The relatively modest financing proposal indicates the severity of the cash squeeze at the Berlin-based firm that, according to Pitchbook data, has raised more than $1.3 billion in capital. It’s part of a turnaround effort that includes talks between Razor and fellow aggregator Infinite Commerce Inc. for a potential merger, the people said, asking not to identified because the process is confidential.

A total of $30 million in bridge financing has been granted to Razor over recent months by lenders such as Victory Park Capital Advisors as well as equity investors including Christian Angermayer’s Presight Capital, the people added.

The company is also working on a potential fundraising with existing shareholders, according to emails sent to investors in late February and seen by Bloomberg News. Communications show that Razor investors were contemplating a financing of at least $75 million alongside the M&A deal.

Spokespeople for Razor, BlackRock and Presight Capital declined to comment on the proposed turnaround. Spokespeople for Victory Park and Infinite Commerce didn’t respond to requests for comment.

E-Commerce Bet
So-called Amazon aggregators buy up firms that sell products via online platforms, with the aim of saving costs on logistics and marketing by bundling brands under one roof. The boom in e-commerce during the pandemic encouraged investors to bet billions on these businesses, but falling consumer demand since the end of lockdown has seen a wave of restructuring across the sector — to the detriment of their investors.

One of their main strategies for plugging holes in these aggregators’ balance sheets has been masterminding consolidation between the e-commerce conglomerates themselves. Infinite Commerce, the potential merger partner, is itself a combination of four brand aggregators that were merged with the help of Victory Park last year.

Razor Group also acquired Perch — another BlackRock investment in the aggregator sector — last year.

BlackRock and Victory Park joined Razor’s roster of lenders in May 2021, according to a statement at the time. However, the investment has since soured with a BlackRock middle-market private credit fund downgraded to junk last week, in part due to “credit challenges” stemming from brand aggregators. That included a $50.3 million unrealized loss on Razor as of Dec. 31.

The publicly traded fund, BlackRock TCP Capital Corp., will “avoid meaningful concentrations in any one industry subsector, such as Amazon aggregators,” Chief Executive Officer Phil Tseng said on a Feb. 27 earnings call.

The industry consolidation is fraught with tension between equity holders — who don’t want to take complete losses on their investments — and creditors, who are usually first to be paid in a liquidation but know they’ll only get pennies on the dollar. The hope is that with further acquisitions, Razor can aim for an initial public offering and offer something in return for all investors.

Razor ran into issues with inventory, according to the emails from late last month. A delay in closing the purchase of Perch as well as liquidity constraints led to a pause in new orders, leading to periods when products were out of stock. Supply-chain issues also contributed to difficulties replenishing stock later, the messages show.

This pressure on earnings eventually led Razor to breach the debt terms of a working capital facility, which then prompted Razor’s other lenders to allege a default on their own financing, according to the emails. This paved the way for discussions over a consensual solution, they show.

BlackRock also was involved in the restructuring of SellerX, another German brand aggregator, and agreed to take a stake in the company as part of a debt-for-equity swap, Bloomberg previously reported. Another of its brand aggregator investments, Thrasio, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year."
2025-03-13T10:16:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/apple-shares-are-losing-haven-allure-as-headwinds-deter-bulls,"For years, investors have talked of Apple Inc. as a potential port of safety in times of market turmoil. That hasn’t been borne out this time around.

The iPhone maker has tumbled in recent sessions, extending its year-to-date underperformance amid a growing number of risks that are overshadowing its traditional high-quality characteristics.

While Apple offers steady earnings growth and sits on a mountain of cash, headwinds form a daunting list for would-be bulls: it is heavily exposed to tariff uncertainty and China, its artificial intelligence offerings have repeatedly fizzled, and its lucrative partnership with Google parent Alphabet Inc. is potentially at risk. It trades at a premium to megacap tech peers despite slower revenue growth, suggesting that the haven case is harder to make for Apple and other big-tech names.

“People like to park in Apple, but right now the stock is expensive, and not only is growth slow, but the catalysts for growth are absent,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. “It doesn’t seem like AI is doing much for it, the environment is very uncertain, and it is very at risk with tariffs and China. While it isn’t as controversial as Tesla, it seems like it is just treading water, and it has been a while since we’ve seen anything truly innovative from it.”

Shares have dropped 14% this year, and are coming off their biggest three-day decline since November 2022, a selloff that took the stock to its lowest close since September. The stock fell an additional 0.8% on Thursday.


The Nasdaq 100 Index is down 7% in 2025, and Apple is responsible for nearly a fifth of that decline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The CBOE Apple VIX, which tracks a market estimate of future volatility for the stock, has risen 56% off a February low.

Recent volatility reflects rising geopolitical risk, especially with respect to tariffs. President Donald Trump recently doubled levies against China to 20%, a potentially significant development for Apple, which counts the country as both as a key manufacturing hub and a major market; it got about 17% of its fiscal 2024 revenue from the greater China region, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana calculates that Apple faces a 100-150 basis point dent on operating margin and a 1-2% hit on sales growth if the surcharge carries on the full fiscal year.

Investors are hoping Apple will get an exemption, as it did during Trump’s first term, and it recently announced domestic spending plans that were seen as a way to curry favor.

Avoiding tariffs might remove an overhang on the stock, but wouldn’t represent much of a catalyst otherwise at a time when investors are anxious to see more robust growth.

Revenue has fallen in five of the past nine quarters, and while analysts expect 4.7% growth in fiscal 2025, this is less than half the 11.8% pace expected for the overall tech sector, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. This is despite Apple trading at 28 times estimated earnings, well above its 10-year average, and a premium to every other Magnificent Seven stock except Tesla Inc.

“There’s so much uncertainty from tariffs, and doubts that it can grow enough to overcome both risks like that and the valuation hurdle,” said Scott Yuschak, managing director of equity strategy at Truist Advisory Services. “It isn’t the stock I’ll worry about first, since its balance sheet is stable and there are other pricey stocks where the businesses aren’t as durable, but I do wrestle with it.”

Yuschak is not alone. Fewer than two-thirds of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, making Apple the least-loved Magnificent 7 stock outside Tesla.

Ed Cofrancesco, chief executive officer of International Assets Advisory, noted that Apple had avoided the kind of heavy AI spending of other big tech companies that is coming under increased scrutiny.

“This isn’t your play if you’re looking for a stock that will triple, but if the economy cools, it’s likely to be a safe haven given the quality and stability of its earnings and balance sheet, and its decades of showing it can pivot in the face of changing conditions,” he said. “There are a lot of land mines in the road ahead, and Apple is better situated to navigate them than other names in tech.”

Intel Corp. shares jumped 14% on Thursday after the chipmaker named Lip-Bu Tan as its CEO. Tan is signaling that he’ll stick with his predecessor Pat Gelsinger’s plan to make chips for other companies, even as he vows to learn from past mistakes.


Investors had been optimistic that the iPhone 16, the first to be compatible with AI features, would entice consumers to trade up for the latest model. However, demand has underwhelmed so far, and in the latest example of its struggles with the cutting-edge technology, it is indefinitely delaying the release of its AI-infused Siri digital assistant.

In a potential positive, however, Apple will use Alibaba’s technology to bring AI features to Apple products in China. Last week, Alibaba said its latest AI model had performance that is comparable to DeepSeek’s despite requiring a fraction of the data."

Domestic wealth in markets such as Japan and Australia is growing, Young Jin Yee said at the FT wealth management forum in Singapore on Thursday. The new teams give customers options for services in Singapore, on top of the bank’s existing operations in both countries, Young said.

The move comes as UBS doubles down in a region that it has long seen as key to its wealth-management ambitions. Newly-installed UBS global co-head of wealth management, Iqbal Khan, who relocated from Zurich to Hong Kong, has reflected on the importance of Asia Pacific.

UBS returned to wealth management in Australia last year after it exited almost a decade ago, tapping the Credit Suisse franchise it bought to make a renewed charge."
2025-03-13T10:27:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/revolut-hiring-hundreds-to-become-a-fully-fledged-uk-bank,"Revolut Ltd. is hiring a hundred new bank staff, from regulatory reporting analysts to financial risk controllers, as it prepares to leave behind the UK central bank’s limits on its operations.

Since gaining its restricted license last summer, the London-headquartered firm has already built its UK banking unit from a team of 35 to over 100 through hires and internal transfers, Francesca Carlesi, Revolut’s UK chief executive officer, said in an interview with Bloomberg News.

By the end of the year, the UK bank should have around 200 staff, she added. The digital challenger was awarded with its long-awaited UK banking license with restrictions in July 2024 by the Prudential Regulation Authority.

“We have been in constant and open dialogue with our regulators, to ensure our mobilization meets the highest standards,” Carlesi said. “We’re in no rush, as getting this right matters more, so once everyone is ready, we’ll launch the UK bank and begin to operate as one of the UK’s newest banks.”

The “mobilization phase” is a common step for many new entrants in the UK, with rivals including Monzo Bank Ltd., Starling Bank Ltd. and Atom Bank Plc going through the process previously. Revolut has been able to trial and run critical banking systems with around 30 customers that have combined deposits of £50,000, Carlesi said.


The regulator normally expects this stage to conclude within 12 months, meaning Revolut would become a fully fledged bank by July. Once the regulator gives the green light, Revolut will be able to migrate its millions of UK customers from its electronic money institution to its UK bank entity — Revolut NewCo UK Ltd.

The $45 billion fintech is one of the largest and fastest-growing companies to take this route. Revolut boss Nik Storonsky has previously said growing the business without bank licenses was a mistake, and that a smaller company would have found it easier to gain licenses than a firm the size of Revolut today.

Revolut is also expected to publish its 2024 accounts in April, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm is set to report roughly $1 billion in profit before tax for 2024, Bloomberg previously reported. That would be a record and up from $545 million a year earlier.

According to the PRA website, new banks usually focus on hiring key personnel, building up risk, internal audit and compliance controls, and making sure the bank is fully capitalized.

Alongside Carlesi, who joined almost a year and a half ago, Revolut has brought on board ex-Standard Chartered Plc executive Richard Holmes as UK chairman, former Lloyds Banking Group Plc auditor Ben Ellis as chief compliance officer, and Carlos Selonke from Banco Santander SA as chief information officer.

With a UK license in hand, Revolut will be able to expand into products such as loans, while customer accounts will be covered by the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which protects deposits of as much as £85,000 ($110,140) if a bank goes bust.

The firm is already a bank in Europe, and plans to roll out its mortgage product in Ireland later in 2025. The fintech was also granted a license in Mexico last year, and is also looking to expand in new markets such as Canada and in recent days has posted jobs listings in South Africa."
2025-03-13T10:30:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/pension-funds-prepare-to-ax-long-standing-bans-on-defense-stocks,"Several pension funds in Europe are reviewing long-standing exclusion policies on weapons manufacturers, as they work to update their portfolios to match the political moment.

PFA Pension, which oversees about $120 billion, told Bloomberg it’s now in talks with its board about removing a ban on holding companies that make components for Western nuclear defense. AkademikerPension, which manages over $20 billion, says it’s asking members whether it can increase exposure to arms manufacturers, including those producing controversial weapons.

Meanwhile Europe’s biggest pension fund, Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, says it’s already an investor in defense companies and is willing to increase its exposure to the sector to support the bloc’s strategic needs.

“This is a special situation,” Jens Munch Holst, the chief executive of AkademikerPension, said in an interview. “It’s a fight for democracy and without democracy we don’t exist. It’s an existential problem right now.”

Holst is part of a growing investor movement in Europe that’s trying to adapt to a dramatically altered geopolitical map. With Donald Trump’s presidency leaving Europeans unsure whether the US remains a reliable ally in a world shaped by Russian aggression, defense spending has become the region’s No. 1 priority.


AkademikerPension is now preparing to ask members whether it should ease restrictions on defense allocations, including lifting a ban on moving into companies that produce controversial weapons such as cluster bombs, said Holst.

ABP already holds somewhere between €400 million ($436 million) and €2 billion in companies that contribute to the defense industry, depending on how broad a definition is applied. But it also cautioned that buying shares on secondary markets isn’t the same as expanding Europe’s defense capacity.

In a written comment to Bloomberg, the Dutch pensions manager said that scaling up requires “a consistent investment policy by governments.” And institutional investors want to see signed defense contracts, ABP said.

At the same time, the investor underscored that “if financing is needed to expand capacity, ABP is willing to invest in it, if the risk and return on that investment are appropriate.”

Rasmus Bessing, the head of ESG investing and co-chief investment officer at PFA, said the fund “would be willing to discuss projects that will provide direct finance to European defense, of course always keeping in mind that we need to assess all investments and” to make sure “they make financial sense.”

He says PFA is still trying to figure out “the most efficient” path forward. “It’s difficult to do early-stage investments” to begin with, and PFA is “a bit reluctant” to do defense investments in private equity or venture capital, he said.

Earlier this month, EU member states requested that the European Commission come up with a list of proposals to boost private finance for defense. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has since signaled that the bloc will do everything it can to free up capital, declaring that with “European values, democracy, freedom, the rule of law” now under threat, “nothing is off the table.”


Regulators in the UK have already made clear that existing sustainable investment rules don’t prohibit fund exposures to the defense industry. And in the EU, existing ESG rules emphasize disclosure rather than restrictions.

PFA has had talks with other pension funds “about the eventual establishment of a fund that could be specialized within this area,” Bessing said. And if the government of Denmark, where PFA is based, were to issue more bonds to finance additional defense spending, he says PFA would likely be ready to buy. “We are a huge buyers of govvies,” Bessing said.

At the same time, many investors adhere to United Nations guidelines as well as principles laid out in other international conventions, which can stand in the way of defense exposures. The UN Principles for Responsible Investment acknowledges that asset managers are currently under pressure to reconsider policies, but says on its website that investors should continue to evaluate the impact on human rights and the risk of fueling civil wars and corruption.

AkademikerPension’s existing exclusion policy affects about 90% of European defense companies and basically all US weapons manufacturers, Holst said. Members will be asked whether they want to lift that internal ban to free the fund to add defense assets. It currently allocates just $45 million to the sector, he said.

Asked whether the fund has any preference for US or European manufacturers, Holst said he thinks “it’s obvious at the moment that most investments will go to the European industry,” based on what policymakers in the region are guiding.

Jenn-Hui Tan, chief sustainability officer at Fidelity International, said even the strictest ESG fund managers can buy defense assets, as long as they’re transparent.

“Clients will choose to make the decisions they make,” Tan said.

Loredana Muharremi, an analyst at Morningstar, said the expectation now is that there’ll be even “greater investment in these areas” going forward as the EU provides further clarification to support such allocations."
2025-03-13T10:35:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/german-mid-caps-set-to-win-big-from-merz-s-investment-package,"Germany’s planned fiscal reform would be a boon for the country’s more domestically-oriented industrial mid-cap stocks.

Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz said earlier this month that he plans to allocate €500 billion ($544 billion) to invest in transportation, energy grids and housing over 10 years. Merz also promised to do “whatever it takes” to defend Europe’s largest economy, including amending the constitution to remove limits on raising debt for defense.

Merz’s historic investment and debt package, if enacted, “could lift both earnings growth and market sentiment” for Germany’s mid-cap MDAX index more than for its large-cap DAX counterpart, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Kaidi Meng and Laurent Douillet.

The mid-cap index’s heavy weighting toward industrial and material stocks – standing at 42% compared with just 31% for DAX – positions it well to benefit from infrastructure funding. Its larger exposure to Germany also makes it more likely to reap the rewards of stronger domestic demand if economic growth picks up on the back of those investments, Meng and Douillet said.


“A stronger, deregulated German economy and lower tax rates are better for domestic revenue generators,” Citigroup Inc. strategists led by Beata Manthey wrote in a note after Merz’s election, adding that they now prefer the MDAX over the DAX as the index is linked to German growth potentially improving.

Merz’s plan sent Germany’s DAX and MDAX indexes soaring, with the MDAX jumping the most in three years. Infrastructure firms such as Bilfinger SE and Hochtief AG were among the biggest gainers the day after the announcement, advancing 18% and 16%, respectively.

Some companies are starting to assess the potential boost. “If these big infrastructure investments come, of course we will have a part of that too,” Bilfinger’s Chief Executive Officer Thomas Schulz said on an earnings call. “As more gets realized, the more we’ll go to the upper range of the revenue.”

Other companies serving the infrastructure end market should also benefit. Wacker Chemie AG “should be a clear beneficiary of Germany’s proposed €500 billion “whatever-it-takes” package,” Citi analysts including Sebastian Satz wrote in a note. Higher construction and industrial activity could lead to a recovery in certain struggling segments like silicones and polymers, Satz added.

Truck-maker Traton SE is optimistic for Germany’s future in the hands of Merz. “With the incoming Chancellor we see very positive signs. We see speed, we see decision-making, we see the Schuldenbremse being up for discussion,” CEO Christian Levin said on a call with analysts, referring to the constitutionally entrenched debt brake that is now up for discussion.

If this spirit of deregulation was carried over into Brussels, “Germany could serve as an example to Europe, the way it used to be years ago,” Levin added.

A sustained rally isn’t guaranteed as the proposals have to first go through the Bundestag, which reconvenes today in a special session to debate the plans. Merz needs the Greens’ support to pass the financing package as he seeks to push through the legislation before the new parliament is seated on March 25, where he would face opposition from both the far-right AfD and Left parties."
2025-03-13T10:40:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/volkswagen-brand-postpones-profitability-target-by-three-years,"Volkswagen AG’s namesake brand pushed back its profitability target by three years as the carmaker contends with muted sales and the costs of slimming down its bloated operations.

VW now aims for a 6.5% operating margin in 2029, rather than next year, as it cuts capacity and workers to offset lower demand in Europe and China. The brand’s returns declined to 2.9% last year, it said Thursday, the lowest since 2020.

“We faced and will continue to face significant headwinds, lower than expected growth in key markets and persistent inflation,” the brand’s Chief Financial Officer David Powels said during a call discussing VW’s earnings.

Slumping sales in China and increasingly stiff competition in Europe — which has yet to return to pre-pandemic demand levels — have weighed on profitability at VW. Past turnaround efforts have been hampered by flubbed electric vehicle launches.

Group Chief Executive Officer Oliver Blume late last year struck a deal with unions to make the brand more efficient. Measures include cutting capacity at its German sites by several hundred thousand units and reducing the workforce by more than 35,000 over the next five years. The brand is projecting an operating margin of more than 4% this year and 5.5% in 2027.

VW is planning several budget EVs to win over Europe’s squeezed consumers, but the first of these — a sub-€25,000 EV dubbed the ID. 2all — won’t be delivered until next year. The brand also has high hopes for the €20,000 ID. EVERY1, a compact EV that’s due to start production in two years in Portugal.

“With small cars, the 6.5% margin expectation is a big one,” Powels said, adding that he’s confident the brand will achieve those returns by 2029.

2025-03-13T10:48:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/mallinckrodt-pharma-endo-reach-deal-for-6-7-billion-merger,"Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals and Endo Inc. plan to merge and create a $6.7 billion company in a move that will cut costs and broaden access to patients and new treatments.

The agreement will give each company’s investors roughly 50% ownership of the combined entity, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Mallinckrodt and Endo said Thursday in a joint statement, confirming an earlier report by Bloomberg News.

Both drugmakers — previously active acquirers in the heyday of large specialty pharmaceutical deals — have emerged from bankruptcies and faced litigation tied to the US opioid crisis in recent years.

Mallinckrodt can trace its history back to the 19th century. The company manufactures specialty branded drugs like Acthar Gel, which treats some autoimmune disorders. It also makes generics including oxycodone tablets, a painkiller, as well as acetaminophen and drugs to treat attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Malvern, Pennsylvania-based Endo generates about half of its revenue from branded pharmaceuticals, including the painkiller Percocet, and Testopel, a testosterone replacement therapy. It also has a large specialty pharmaceutical business, according to its latest quarterly report.


The enlarged company should generate $75 million of synergies in the first year of the merger, and at least $150 million by the third, and $75 million in year one, according to the statement. Mallinckrodt and Endo also said they plan to combine their generic drugs divisions with Endo’s sterile injectables unit and separate that from the group at a later stage.

Both companies are among drug manufacturers that settled lawsuits tied to the opioid crisis in the US. Dublin, Ireland-headquartered Mallinckrodt went bankrupt twice in less than three years, most recently filing for Chapter 11 in 2023 in an attempt to cut its debt load and reduce liabilities from an opioid settlement. Endo filed for bankruptcy in 2022 for similar reasons.

Following the combination, the companies said they will have a stronger balance sheet and cash flow with more opportunities for external growth, potentially including pursuing acquisitions of commercial-stage drug assets.

Siggi Olafsson, president and chief executive officer of Mallinckrodt, will hold the same position at the enlarged group. Paul Efron, a board director at Endo, will become chairman. Mallinckrodt’s Dublin headquarters will become the HQ of the enlarged company, with the new corporate name and US head office location revealed at a later stage.

The combination will be funded with cash on hand and $900 million of financing from Goldman Sachs & Co., which also acted as Endo’s financial adviser. Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP is Endo’s lead counsel, with Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and A&L Goodbody LLP also serving as legal advisers.

Lazard Inc. acted as financial adviser to Mallinckrodt, with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz providing lead counsel and Hogan Lovells and Arthur Cox LLP also providing legal advice.

This week, Endo also reached an agreement to divest its international pharmaceuticals business to Knight Therapeutics Inc. for a total consideration of as much as $99 million."
2025-03-13T10:57:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/spain-s-sanchez-seeks-backing-to-reach-nato-s-spending-target,"Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez sought to reassure other political parties that higher spending on defense will not affect social expenditure, and that it could represent an opportunity for the country.

“The Spanish government’s commitment is undeniable, firm, and decisive,” Sanchez said Thursday after talks with the leaders of nine parties to muster support for boosting defense spending and meeting NATO targets. “We will not cut a single cent from social policy and social cohesion to meet this commitment we have with Europe and our own country in the areas of security and defense.”

As Europe urgently rushes to rearm, Sanchez said last week that Spain will reach NATO’s target of spending the equivalent of at least 2% of gross domestic product on defense by 2029. This would mark a major shift for the country, which has fallen short of the goal for years and spends less than all other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

He reiterated that the country will reach the 2% goal on Thursday, without giving more details. He said it could be an opportunity for Spain “because the commitment to a larger budget for security and defense will be a commitment to the country’s technology and industry.”

It’s unclear how the Socialist leader plans to get backing, given that he doesn’t have a majority in parliament and requires support from a coterie of parties to pass legislation, including at least four that are vocally opposed to spending more on defense.

Spain has for years had an ambivalent position about military spending. Its decision to join NATO in the mid-1980s marked a watershed political moment under a different Socialist government, requiring the party to make a big ideological shift. Many voters on the far left are still opposed to being part of NATO. The country also severely cut spending on weapons, bullets and even military training during the 2008-2012 economic crisis, and has under-invested since then.


The first major hurdle is winning over the government’s junior coalition partner, Sumar. Sanchez met for about two hours on Tuesday with Sumar leader and Labor Minister Yolanda Diaz, who’s also a deputy prime minister, to try to make the case for supporting increased spending. Sumar has previously said it doesn’t favor more investments in weapons and military.

An alternative would be to strike a deal with the conservative People’s Party, the largest group in parliament and the Socialists’ main rival, but it’s not clear that this is doable given the acrimonious relationship between Sanchez and PP leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo.

While Sanchez is supportive of Ukraine in the war against Russia, and has repeatedly said that Europe must stand by Kyiv, he’s stopped short of committing to sending troops and — until last week — of increasing defense spending. Instead, he’s chosen to underline his commitment to peace and Spain’s extensive track record in United Nations-backed peace missions across the globe.

The Sumar party does back higher spending through European funds, a position that’s also supported by the Socialists."
2025-03-13T10:58:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/shell-delivered-record-amount-of-marine-lng-to-ships-in-2024,"Shell Plc said it delivered record volumes of liquefied natural gas to power ships last year, boosting the use of a fuel that’s become crucial to the energy transition.

The company’s deliveries reached 1.1 million tons, according to the supermajor, which is one of the largest LNG shipping operators.

The shipping industry spews hundreds of millions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere each year and is under mounting pressure to decarbonize. LNG, emitting less carbon than oil-derived ship propellant, has been touted as a key bridge fuel during the switch to cleaner energy. Yet it still releases pollutants, including large amounts of methane.

“Demand for LNG-fueled vessels is picking up pace,” Tom Summers, senior vice president for Shell LNG Marketing & Trading, said in an email on Thursday. “LNG helps ship owners to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”


The company last month raised its long-term forecast for global LNG demand, saying consumption will surge by about 60% into 2040. It expects the number of LNG-powered vessels to almost double in the next five years.

While the European Union has introduced rules that target ships’ emissions, the global marine fuel market is still dominated by oil. LNG only accounted for about 6% of consumption in 2023, according to from the International Maritime Organization, the industry’s regulator.

The amount of methane escaping from LNG-fueled ships is higher than assumed by the IMO, according to a study last year by environmental researchers. One critic of the use of LNG to power vessels, Fortescue Ltd.’s billionaire Chairman Andrew Forrest, has plans to tap green ammonia instead.

Methane is the second-largest contributor to global warming, after carbon dioxide. Shell aims to keep the methane intensity of its operated assets below 0.2% this year and achieve near-zero methane emissions by the end of the decade."
2025-03-13T11:00:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/banks-share-private-information-to-snag-debt-trades-study-says,"Global banks appear to be giving top clients private information to win corporate-bond trading business, according to a new study showing the $56 billion-a-day market is stacked in favor of the most active investors with the broadest dealer networks.

The study examined the profitability of trades by insurance companies, which are whales in the credit world. It found that those with the best access to Wall Street’s bond-trading desks often had better outcomes than other investors ahead of market-moving events, such as mergers and acquisitions and rating downgrades.

Critically, the more important an insurer is to a dealer’s business, the more prescient their trades ahead of M&A transactions tend to be — especially if the dealer is part of a bank also involved in the takeover. The pattern holds even when taking into account the pricing benefits offered by large dealer networks, professors at Rice University, Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania discovered.

The trio are careful to avoid the term “insider trading” in their analysis of the data, published late last year, noting that dealers could potentially be doling out “private information” without necessarily providing “privileged information.” Still, their findings raise critical questions of fairness in one of the world’s largest and most important financial markets.


The results indicate private information is being used as payment for order flow, the authors wrote. That suggests a potential breakdown in the walls that are supposed to prevent information from one side of a bank flowing to another — a mainstay of US financial industry controls for decades.

“The surprising part to us was the results we found around these M&A deals because we know that we have all these ethical barriers inside the banks,” Rice’s Stefan Huber said in an interview. “Picking up at least some trading that looks informed ahead of these deals was a little shocking.”

The authors didn’t link any specific banks to the patterns they observed. JPMorgan Chase & Co. was the most active dealer based on trading volume in the study, followed by Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to Huber, who conducted the analysis with Yale’s Edward Watts and Penn’s Christina Zhu.

Representatives for all five banks declined to comment, as did spokespeople for the Securities and Exchange Commission and Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.

Some finance industry professionals were skeptical of the study. William Cunningham has worked on both sides of these trades, having been the head of credit portfolio management, research and trading for Nationwide Insurance and, before that, a credit strategist at JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch & Co.

“People talk and whisper and stuff like that, but it’s not organized and it’s not significant,” Cunningham said.

The researchers chose to zero in on insurance companies because, in addition to being among the biggest players in the US corporate-bond market, that’s where they could source the best data.


Every quarter insurers have to report their financial-market transactions to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a consortium of state regulators. Those filings contain detailed information on each trade they make, including the dealer on the other side.

By analyzing roughly 2 million trades between 2009 and 2022, the researchers were able to map out the dealer networks of 1,577 insurers.

They then overlaid that dealer network data with M&A transaction figures to examine the trading activity of insurance companies in the bonds of takeover targets. What they discovered was that insurers that traded with more dealers showed “improved decision making in the 30 trading days before these deals are publicly announced.”

And it wasn’t as simple as, bigger insurers made better decisions. It turns out that trading with more banks that have merger and acquisition businesses seems to result in better outcomes for insurers.

While the analysis of trading ahead of credit rating downgrades and defaults was slightly different, the results proved similar.

All told, the insurers in the top quintile for dealer-network size got an advantage of about 0.84 percentage point in annual returns compared with all the others. That’s a meaningful difference in a market where US investment-grade corporate debt yields average just 5.24%.

Information Advantage
Still, the outsized gains associated with larger networks don’t necessarily mean that dealers are passing on private information.

To test for this, the researchers divided the roughly 370 dealers involved in the underlying trades into two groups: those with investment-bank divisions that advised on at least one M&A transaction in the previous 12 months, and those without.

That data showed that when an investor has a connection with an M&A-affiliated dealer, they sell bonds to a greater extent prior to acquisition announcements that negatively affect debt prices. The more connections investors have to dealers involved in a transaction, the more pronounced the results.


What’s more, by taking into account how important an insurer’s trading business is to M&A-affiliated dealers, the researchers determined that the prevalence of informed trades ahead of M&A transactions increases in relation to past order volume between the insurer and the bank.

“These results are consistent with dealers rewarding their best trading clients with private information for order flow,” the researchers wrote, and are potentially “indicative of breakdown of ‘ethical walls’ established by the Glass Steagall Act.”

Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and technology research at Crisil Coalition Greenwich, said he has little doubt “helpful” information is being shared by corporate bond dealers.

“Information is definitely being shared. The more connected you are, the more likely you are to get more helpful information in terms of your trading practice,” said McPartland. “The question is if the information that’s being traded falls within the regulations of what’s allowed to be shared? And that’s something that we can’t really know based on the study,” he noted.

“If you’re a bigger asset manager and you have many traders and portfolio managers who are talking to many dealers and research people, then that’s just more information. And if you have the people and systems in place to distill that information and make decisions from it, ultimately being more informed is going to be beneficial.”

‘Not Systemic’
Others question the study’s conclusions entirely.

Cunningham, the former portfolio manager at Nationwide, says there isn’t any kind of concerted effort for dealers to hand over key information to bigger investors.

“Yes, there’s always leakage, stuff like that, but it’s not systemic and it’s kind of natural,” Cunningham said.

“A lot of smaller players — asset buy-side players, be it the insurance companies or asset managers — they do complain that the larger shops get the first look in a lot of things,” he added. But it’s basically access to new deals, access to trading flows, he said. “It’s not proprietary.”


In other words, banks may be passing along information that isn’t public, but also isn’t material enough to move the price of a security by itself.

Huber, Watts and Zhu, for their part, say that if anything, their findings likely undersell the informational value of trading relationships. Insurers are widely considered less active in the market on a day-to-day basis than other participants such as hedge funds, and therefore are less likely to engage in information-based trading.

While Huber stressed that the study is not a call to action, the authors do suggest that greater scrutiny by regulators may be warranted in the US corporate-bond market.

The evidence “highlights potentially unfair advantages being garnered by informed traders in these markets through investors’ dealer networks,” they concluded.

2025-03-13T11:00:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/big-tech-must-be-held-to-account-for-sextortion-scams-watchdog-says,"Some of the world’s largest social media platforms should “fundamentally” be held responsible for their role in facilitating sextortion scams that target children, according to the head of a global dirty-money watchdog.

Elisa de Anda Madrazo, president of the Financial Action Task Force, said the group is focused on combating one of the world’s fastest-growing crimes. In a new report, the Paris-based inter-governmental body said financial intelligence can be leveraged to disrupt online child sexual exploitation. The research also delved into the role apps such as Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook play in initially connecting perpetrators to victims.

“Kids really suffer from this crime, and it stays with them in the long term,” De Anda said in an interview Wednesday with Bloomberg News. “Sadly, some children take their own lives because they feel there’s no way out.”

De Anda said that social media platforms, governments and financial institutions can also be part of the solution, touting recent public-private collaboration to investigate the networks behind these crimes.

The FATF, which has about 40 members including the US, China and the European Commission, sets standards on anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing. Its report focused on two crimes: live-streamed sexual abuse of children and sextortion, where a perpetrator threatens to expose sexually compromising information unless the victim sends money. For the former, much of the consumer demand stems from Australia, Europe and North America, the group found. In the case of sextortion, many perpetrators are from Nigeria, the Philippines and the Ivory Coast, according to the FATF.

A Bloomberg Businessweek investigation last year detailed the rapid rise of sextortion in the US. Weeks later, Meta Platforms Inc. — the owner of Facebook and Instagram — said it had removed more than 60,000 accounts in Nigeria linked to scammers who were using its social media services to blackmail targets after soliciting intimate photos.

“Criminals are the ones profiting,” De Anda said. “The challenge is following the money across multiple jurisdictions. Institutions and governments have a responsibility to follow these suspicious transactions all the way.”"

Turkey has never publicly said when its waiver from sanctions on Gazprombank JSC, granted in December, is to expire. However, the officials said the relief period is due to end March 20 — a week from now – and that Ankara is working to extend it. They asked not to be identified because the matter isn’t public.

More than 45% of Turkey’s gas imports came from Russia last year, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data from the national energy regulator. Those supplies have been crucial during a colder-than-usual winter and will remain important in the summer because hydropower generation is expected to decline.

Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek is scheduled to hold a call with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week to request the extension, the officials said.

The US sanctioned Gazprombank, a vital conduit for energy payments, in November to squeeze Russia’s income from gas sales, but later granted exemptions to major importers Turkey and Hungary.


Turkey’s Treasury and Finance Ministry, as well as the Energy Ministry, declined to comment. The US Treasury didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside normal working hours."
2025-03-13T11:02:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/dollar-general-rises-with-sales-guidance-higher-than-estimates,"Dollar General Corp. forecast sales to grow this year in a range with the top end higher than what Wall Street expected, giving investors optimism that the discount chain’s recent woes are easing.

The Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based retailer said comparable sales will gain as much as 2.2% this year. Analysts projected growth of about 1.8% on average.

Dollar General and other discounters have been struggling along with their low-income customers, a trend the retailer said continued into this year. Analysts have also said big-box rivals such as Walmart Inc. are taking market share.

Shares of Dollar General rose as much as 6% on Thursday. The stock had gained 1.3% this year through Wednesday.

The retailer sees earnings per share this year in a range of $5.10 to $5.80, with the top end narrowly trailing the average Wall Street estimate.

Last quarter, comparable sales and revenue beat estimates, with Dollar General pointing to a strong performance in the consumables category and declines in seasonal, home and apparel.

That came even as customers remained under pressure, with some shoppers pulling back on necessities, Chief Executive Officer Todd Vasos said Thursday on the earnings call.

Profit Miss
Profit last quarter missed badly, with the company citing the impact of the costs associated with the review of its store profile and closing locations. The chain reported earnings of 87 cents a share, while Wall Street’s average projection was $1.50.


Dollar General has “emerged from the doldrums that plagued the chain,” said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData. This year will continue a “gentle rebuilding,” but “a lot more work is needed” for the chain to get back to being a “powerhouse” among value retailers, he said.

Adding to Dollar General’s challenges are rising concerns about a pullback in consumer spending. Retailers, including Walmart, Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. and Macy’s Inc., have underwhelmed investors with their outlooks for this year. Some chains have pointed to the potential for President Donald Trump’s tariffs to trigger price increases.

Dollar General had been cruising for years, with robust sales growth and its stock surging. The chain’s main growth engine was opening thousands of new stores. The retailer topped 20,000 locations this year, making it the largest chain in the US.

But that formula didn’t hold up. The performance of existing stores weakened, and the chain has invested in improving them. That’s included simplifying operations, by reducing how many products stores sell, and remodeling thousands of locations.

The company plans to open about 575 stores this year."
2025-03-13T11:04:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/swiss-keep-state-street-for-pensions-dismissing-trump-fears,"State Street Corp. will remain custodian of a 46 billion-franc ($52 billion) Swiss pension hoard after lawmakers narrowly rejected a bid to reassert domestic control as a guard against US strong-arming of the country.

The lower house in Bern voted 98-89 on Thursday in favor of preserving the Boston-based bank’s mandate for the social security funds. The majority dismissed fears that the administration of US President Donald Trump could order State Street to withhold payments as a bargaining chip to pressure Switzerland.

The outcome is a victory for the bank after recent setbacks in other European countries over its climate-change policy. It means state agency Compenswiss, which oversees the fund, won’t need to rerun a tender process completed in late 2023 that ended UBS Group AG’s quarter-century mandate.

Lawmakers voted according to the advice of the Swiss government, which had warned that revoking State Street’s contract within the first five years would mean significant extra costs.

The law proposed by a parliamentary committee in January has showcased Switzerland’s nervousness about Trump. While the US president hasn’t singled it out with tariffs that could soon hit the neighboring European Union, memories linger of how the country was branded a currency manipulator during his first term of office.


If the bill had ultimately passed, UBS would have been in a prime position to regain the mandate. That could have risked reviving domestic worries about its dominance in the Swiss economy after it was forced to take over Credit Suisse two years ago.

Concern over Switzerland’s attractiveness as a location for banks featured in the parliamentary debate, with Interior Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider declaring that the bill would have “damaged the reputation of Switzerland as a financial center” and Kathrin Bertschy of the Green Liberals arguing that annulling State Street’s contract would hurt the perception of legal certainty.

Still, Thomas Matter, a lawmaker for the right-wing Swiss People’s Party, highlighted that the pension assets were “systemically relevant.”

“We have to avoid even the smallest risk, because these assets are ultimately the substance of our retirement funds,” he said.

For State Street, which is one of the world’s biggest custodian banks supporting $46.6 trillion in assets, the mandate generates revenues in the high-single digit millions annually, according to a person familiar with the matter. Winning the contract was a big symbolic victory against the dominance of Swiss institutions.

As a custodian of the assets State Street has appointed local depository banks to handle the funds, meaning no Swiss savings have actually left the Switzerland when State Street got the mandate. Less than a third of the $52 billion are held in the US.

“The bank takes note and is pleased with the decision and will continue to fulfil this mandate with due diligence, drawing on our more than 230 years of experience,” a State Street spokesman said in an emailed statement.

State Street is not the only US bank coming under scrutiny in Switzerland. This week, two socialist lawmakers questioned Zurich’s cantonal government about $36 billion held at JPMorgan Chase & Co. by the canton’s BVK pension fund. This issue remains open."
2025-03-13T11:11:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/france-s-borrowing-costs-near-14-year-high-before-fitch-review,"France’s long-term borrowing costs are nearing the highest level in over a decade ahead of a possible downgrade of the nation’s sovereign rating on Friday.

The 30-year bond yield rose five basis points to 4.15% on Thursday, just one basis point away from the most elevated since 2011. The rate is up more than 40 basis points this month due to the selloff in European bond markets ignited by Germany’s plans to boost spending.

Fitch Ratings is schedule to review on Friday France’s AA- credit score, which holds a negative outlook since October. The firm last month issued a warning that the country’s fiscal consolidation had been scaled back, and since then the government has promised to increase defense spending, placing a further strain on public finances.



French markets were roiled last year following President Emmanuel Macron’s call for a snap election, almost doubling the premium on 10-year notes over safer German peers to more than 90 basis points. The spread has since fallen back to around 68 basis points after Prime Minister Francois Bayrou forced through a budget and survived subsequent confidence votes which befell his predecessor.


Still, Citigroup Inc. expects a downgrade will come eventually, and strategist Aman Bansal warns that if the rating is lowered to a single-A band, some investors would be forced to sell the securities. S&P Global Ratings also has France at AA- with a negative outlook, while Moody’s rates it at equivalent Aa3 with a stable outlook."

These concerns seem to be hitting spending by both rich and poor, across necessities and luxuries, all at once.

Take low-income consumers: At an interview at the Economic Club of Chicago in late February, Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said “budget-pressured” customers are showing stressed behaviors: They are buying smaller pack sizes at the end of the month because their “money runs out before the month is gone.” McDonald’s said in its most recent earnings call that the fast-food industry has had a “sluggish start” to the year, in part because of weak demand from low-income consumers. Across the U.S. fast-food industry, sales to low-income guests were down by a double-digit percentage in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, according to McDonald’s.

Dollar General on its earnings call on Thursday said its customers report only having enough money for basic essentials; some are having to sacrifice even on necessities. The company doesn’t expect any improvement in the economic environment this year and is watching potential changes to government entitlement programs. Dollar stores rely more heavily on food-stamp benefits, which could be on the table for budget cuts.
Things don’t look much better on the higher end. American consumers’ spending on the luxury market, which includes high-end department stores and online platforms, fell 9.3% in February from a year earlier, worse than the 5.9% decline in January, according to Citi’s analysis of its credit-card transactions data.

Costco, whose membership-fee-paying customer base skews higher-income, said last week that demand has shifted toward lower-cost proteins such as ground beef and poultry. Its members are still spending but are being “very choiceful” about where they spend, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said. He said consumers could become even pickier if they see more inflation from tariffs. Dollar General said Thursday that sales to higher-earning households, who are seeking cheaper options, accelerated in the past few weeks.

Department stores are seeing signs of penny-pinching all around, too. On Tuesday, Kohl’s CEO Ashley Buchanan said consumers making less than $50,000 a year are “pretty constrained” on discretionary spending, but added that “it’s also pretty challenging” for those making less than $100,000. The company gave a much weaker sales forecast for the full year than Wall Street expected, causing its share price to plunge 24% on Tuesday. Last week, Macy’s CEO Tony Spring said the “affluent customer that’s shopping [at] Macy’s is just as uncertain and as confused and concerned by what’s transpiring.” "

There’s a brand new three star restaurant, Amber in the Landmark Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong from chef Richard Ekkebus. His sustainably-minded menu features dishes like Bluenose sea bass with juniper, fermented cabbage and Kintoa bacon with vegetarian alternatives and starts at HK $2,058 ($265). Amber was promoted from two stars; it also has a Michelin green star, it’s eco-minded award.

There’s now a total of nine 3-star restaurants: seven in Hong Kong and two in Macau. It’s the same number as last year. (One of last year’s winners, l’Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Hong Kong is currently closed for renovations.)

In fact, it was a good night for Macau’s restaurants in casino properties. Besides the freshly minted two-star Chef Tam’s Seasons, new one stars included Aji at the MGM Cotai with a Japanese-accented menu; Sushi Kissho by Miyakawa at Raffles at the Galaxy Macau casino; and Zuicho in the Grand Lisboa Palace Resort. The guest of honor was Daisy Ho, co-chairman and executive director of SJM Holdings, and daughter of the late Macau casino billionaire Stanley Ho.

""Macau is more than just a gambling center, it has lifestyle, it has its own magic,"" said Adam Pang from Pang's Kitchen, a one star winner, which has a location in Galaxy Macau. “It's a bit overwhelming, and I am pleasantly surprised after being in Hong Kong for so many years,” said Richard Ekkebus, chef of Amber, who won three star this year. “This year we celebrate so many different types of cuisines, that's the beauty of the Michelin guide.”


There’s now a total of 69 one star restaurants between Hong Kong and Macau and 95 starred restaurants in total; 76 in Hong Kong and 19 in Macau. It’s the same total number of starred places as last year, but in 2024, Hong Kong had 79 starred spots and Macau had 16.

The event took place in Macau in the grand hall of the Grand Lisboa Palace Resort Macau, announcements were in both English and Cantonese. The giant room was packed with chefs and attendees holding glasses of Champagne and cheering when prompted.

Michelin also handed out some dedicated awards in categories like Service, which was given to Winnie Zhang at the ornate Wing Lei restaurant in the Wynn, which retained its two-star ranking.

Last week, Michelin announced its Bib Gourmands, or cheap eats. There are now 77 spots, including 10 new ones. Among the newly selected places in Hong Kong are Hung's Delicacies, where the specialty is Chiuchow cuisine and there’s a focus on meats and offal. Another new lace is Lulu Baobao, well-pleated xiao long bao and a good assortment of noodle dishes."
2025-03-13T11:36:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/starmer-scraps-nhs-england-seeking-greater-control-of-health,"Keir Starmer said he’s scrapping NHS England, the arms-length body that manages the state-run health service, to give ministers more control over £200 billion ($259 billion) of spending as the prime minister tries to deliver on his election pledge to reduce waiting times and improve outcomes.

The anticipated move follows mounting criticism over poor productivity in the NHS, with patient waiting lists soaring in the aftermath of the pandemic and a growing number of hospital operators facing financial deficits. It’s just weeks since NHS England said its chief executive Amanda Pritchard would be leaving.

It reverses a reorganization under the Conservatives in the early 2010s that the new Labour government says created layers of bureaucracy without clear accountability. Starmer came to power promising to overhaul the NHS, though he often warned its problems can’t be solved just by boosting funding.

During a speech on government efficiency in northern England, Starmer said it was hard to explain to the British people why such a huge portion of state spending was funneled into “two layers of bureaucracy.” Politicians of all stripes — including from his Labour Party — were guilty over the years of outsourcing decisions to reviews, consultations and agencies, he said.


“That money could and should be spent on nurses, doctors operations, GP appointments,” he said Thursday. The change “will put the NHS back at the heart of government where it belongs,” the prime minister continued, “freeing it to focus on patients, less bureaucracy, with more money for nurses: An NHS refocused to cutting waiting times at your hospital.”

The stakes are high for Starmer, whose hopes of winning the next election due in 2029 could hinge on whether voters think Labour has delivered on its promise to rebuild the UK’s public services. The NHS is a major part of that, after waiting lists rose to a record under the previous Conservative administration.

But while polls show voters trust Labour — which founded the NHS in the aftermath of World War II — more than any other party on health care, some of the government’s early moves to deal with the crisis are controversial. Outsourcing more patients to private hospitals, for example, has helped treat people faster, while reigniting fears about creeping privatization.

The upheaval also poses a risk. Pritchard will leave at the end of March, while National Medical Director Stephen Powis said last week he would leave in the summer. Pritchard will be replaced by James Mackey as a “transition” CEO with a remit to “radically reshape” how NHS England and the health department work together, according to a Feb. 25 statement.

Starmer’s spokesman, Dave Pares, said work would begin immediately on making health care more efficient, including by stripping out roles duplicated between NHS England and the government’s health department, such as communications jobs. The full transition to bring the agency’s work back under direct ministerial control is expected to take two years, he said.

Matthew Taylor, chief executive of NHS Confederation, and Daniel Elkeles, incoming chief executive of NHS Providers, called it the “biggest reshaping” of the service in a decade, and warned of disruption during the transition.


“We have been left with two large organizations doing the same roles with an enormous amount of duplication,” Health Secretary Wes Streeting told the House of Commons soon after Starmer’s speech. “Such bloated and inefficient bureaucracy cannot be justified.”

Responding for the Conservatives, shadow Health Minister Caroline Johnson said her party is “supportive of measures to streamline the management, and we do not oppose the principles of taking direct control” of the health service.

Streeting said since coming to power, the government had made progress on the NHS, including brokering a pay deal with doctors to end strikes, delivering 2 million extra appointments in seven months, and slashing waiting lists by 193,000. That has happened over the winter period, when lists would normally tick upwards.

“The NHS is broken, but it is not beaten,” said Streeting. “This Labour government will never duck the hard yards of reform. We will take on vested interests and change the status quo.”

The overhaul in health care feeds into the wider aim of Starmer’s government to revive Britain’s flagging economy by boosting productivity, including by slashing red tape and paring back agencies and other arms-length bodies.

Starmer also touted £45 billion in annual productivity savings that could be achieved through digitizing public services and harnessing artificial intelligence. “No person’s substantive time should be spent on a task where digital or AI can do it better, quicker and to the same high quality and standard,” he said."

The peso rose around 0.4% against the dollar. That jump helped a broader gauge of developing-nation currencies erase its losses and end the day little changed at market close. Eastern European counterparts were among the worst performers while the dollar edged higher and Treasury yields fell.

“The tariff environment and the uncertainty that comes along with tariffs continue to linger over the EM FX complex for the time being,” said Brendan McKenna, emerging market strategist at Wells Fargo in New York.

In a Thursday morning interview with Bloomberg Television, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick lauded Mexico and the UK for a comparatively restrained response to US tariffs.

“You have some countries that actually thoughtfully examine how they do business with us,” he said. For those nations that “go right back to old-school” tit-for-tat measures “the president’s going to deal with them with strength and with power.”


Markets remain concerned about the possible impact Trump’s trade policies could have on economic growth, with asset prices facing heightened volatility in recent weeks. The mounting fears rattled Wall Street again on Thursday, pushing the S&P 500 into a correction that left it at the lowest level in six months.

NEWS: Stocks Tumble Into Correction as Trump Policies Roil Sentiment

In an escalation, Trump threatened to enact a 200% tariff on European wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages. Later Thursday, Trump said he would not repeal levies on steel and aluminum that took effect this week, nor back off plans for sweeping reciprocal tariffs on trading parters set to start as soon as April 2.

Elsewhere in currency markets, central and eastern European currencies were among the biggest losers versus the greenback. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he wants to discuss a proposed ceasefire in Ukraine with his US counterpart, though he warned that any truce should lead to a long-term resolution of the war.

Serbia’s central bank left the benchmark interest rate unchanged for a sixth month as price pressures persist and the government confronts the biggest political protests in a decade. In Romania, which is also facing continued political turmoil, inflation also unexpectedly edged higher last month.

Stocks, Bonds
In equity markets, emerging-market shares fell, driven by a slump in technology stocks in Asia, after hedge funds trimmed their bullish wagers in the region, having already dumped some bets in the US and Europe.

The benchmark index for EM stocks dropped more than 0.4%, led lower by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.

“The recent selloff has been triggered by investor positioning where hedge funds have started reducing risk and realizing profits where they have them,” said Rajeev De Mello, portfolio manager at Gama Asset Management SA. “As we approach the end of the quarter and with more significant tariffs signaled for early April, I would expect a further deterioration.”


Goldman Sachs saw the largest decline in hedge fund positions in Asia in four years on Monday. While much of the fall came from developed countries, China dominated the reduction in emerging markets in Asia, led by hedge funds trimming bullish wagers, it added.

In credit markets, Indonesia’s sovereign dollar bonds were among the worst-performers in EM, after officials there posted an unlikely budget deficit as of February due to a double digit drop in state revenues, adding to concerns about the health of government finances."
2025-03-13T12:00:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/-buy-the-dip-calls-fade-as-trump-selloffs-rattle-wall-street,"In a few short weeks, President Donald Trump has started silencing the buy-the-dip stock traders who set the tone on Wall Street for the better part of two decades.

In their place are growing calls to lock in profits and sit on the sidelines while Trump’s trade-war chaos upends the economic outlook — and casts uncertainty over who, if anyone, will emerge as the new era’s stock-market winners.

“Buying the dip now is like buying discounted tickets to a show without knowing who’s performing,” said Dave Mazza, chief executive officer of Roundhill Investments. “Unlike the recent path when buying every dip was reliable, the heightened uncertainty of tariffs and trade policy means investors could end up with either a blockbuster or a flop.”

The sentiment is a sign of just how much Trump has rattled Wall Street’s once prevalent bull-market faith by moving to roll back the globalization that’s powered the world economy for decades and slash the government spending that’s provided a steady jolt of stimulus at home.


But as much as the policies themselves has been the return of Trump’s style — a scattershot approach that’s resulting in a dizzying cycle of tariffs that are called on, off and on again. And that volatility has shattered confidence that any bounceback — like the one that lifted stock prices Wednesday — won’t reverse as quickly as it appeared.

“Uncertainty is probably here to stay for a while,” said Burns McKinney, managing director and senior portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group.

That uncertainty has pulled down what had been one of the strongest US bull runs since the Internet bubble of the 1990s, one that was stoked by swelling corporate profits and speculation that America’s tech giants would lead the coming artificial-intelligence revolution. That drove the Nasdaq 100 Index to gains of 54% in 2023 and 25% last year.

Even with rising doubts about whether valuations had run up too far, that rally had supported a buy-the-dip mentality. Last year, until late July, the S&P 500 went 356 days without logging a 2% decline, the longest such winning streak since the Global Financial Crisis, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.

Since mid-February, the S&P has charted a steep pullback from its record high and is on the threshold of a technical correction, meaning a drop of 10% or more from its recent peak.

Despite some attempts to snap up discounted stocks — like Wednesday’s 0.5% increase in the index after two down days — the S&P 500 hasn’t notched two consecutive days of gains since its February peak. Already, yesterday’s bounce is fading, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both lower Thursday morning after Trump threatened tariffs on EU wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages, dashing a slight rebound following solid economic data.


The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 has similarly failed to see back-to-back up days since its record, and the gauge fell into correction territory in early March.

“Coming into the year, stocks looked overvalued by more than 10%,” said NFJ Investment Group’s McKinney. But, he added, “that doesn’t necessarily mean that suddenly we would just dive right in.”

No Capitulation Yet
That’s in part because market watchers say they don’t see some of the signs that generally indicate a meaningful rebound rally is in the works. That includes what’s know as capitulation — or an across the board selloff that shows sentiment has gotten far too negative and is poised to reverse.

In fact, data from Bank of America Corp. show that clients bought stocks for a sixth straight week through last week. Junk-bond spreads aren’t at alarmingly levels. And the so-called fear gauge — the Cboe Volatility Index — shows volatility is increasing but not at red-flag levels.

“We’re now in capital preservation” mode, said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Robert W Baird & Co., who said the market, and particularly the technology sector, is also facing some of the usual spring headwinds. He said anyone looking to swoop in now hasn’t “been through some very ugly cycles.”

The attitude, of course, is far from universal, and even the latest round of growth fears hasn’t done away with the generally bullish 2025 calls from Wall Street’s market forecasters. Citigroup Inc. strategist Scott Chronert, for one, says the recent pullback in the S&P 500 makes the risk-reward more compelling. And others are still seizing on the chance to hunt for some bargains.

“These are opportunities to buy really good stocks at much more attractive multiples, especially the tech names,” said Shana Sissel, chief investment officer at Banrion Capital Management.

Still, caution is always warranted for investors who are essentially attempting to time the market. While index corrections can be healthy cycles for stocks, sentiment can easily switch from cautious to fearful, setting up a much bigger market selloff.


“It’s hard to know when the bottom is,” said Tanvir Sandhu, chief global derivatives strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Catching the falling knife is never a good thing.”"
2025-03-13T12:00:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/trump-s-cdc-pick-would-add-another-vaccine-critic-in-health-role,"A physician who spent decades disparaging the life-saving measles vaccine is poised to be the next head of the largest US public-health agency.

David Weldon, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has previously spread debunked theories linking childhood vaccination to autism. If he’s ultimately confirmed following Thursday’s hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Weldon will be in charge of the vaccine schedule doctors typically follow to administer shots to kids.

Experts say this marks a threat to the nation’s health, as Weldon would join US Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as a powerful voice sowing doubt about the safety of childhood vaccines.

Kennedy had promised to “make America healthy again.” So far he’s moved to cut the agency’s staff, canceled a vaccine advisory meeting and said that “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one” even as a deadly measles epidemic rages in the US.


“When you withhold vaccination, you’re doing nothing to reduce the chance your child will be diagnosed with autism, but you are absolutely increasing the chance that they will contract a preventable disease and possibly die,” said Alison Singer, co-founder and president of the Autism Science Foundation.

Weldon, 71, has repeatedly promoted the idea that a once-common vaccine preservative has links to childhood autism. The mercury-based preservative, thimerosal, was removed from childhood vaccines in the US in 2001. But Weldon recently told Senator Patty Murray that children may be exposed to toxic levels of mercury through the government’s recommended immunization schedule.

‘Remain Vigilant’
In his prepared testimony for his Senate hearing, Weldon said he would recommend that children get measles vaccines. He also wrote that “we must remain vigilant in questioning our assumptions” and “guard against the dangers from blind spots, echo chambers, silos and group think.”

Weldon, an internist by training, won a seat in the US House of Representatives in 1994, running for office to oppose then-First Lady Hillary Clinton’s efforts to enact universal health care in the US.

As a congressman, Weldon repeatedly voiced concerns about links between thimerosal and childhood autism. In 2007, he introduced a bill that would have stripped the CDC of the power to oversee vaccine safety and instead establish a new agency within the health department.

He has spoken on behalf of parents who accuse the CDC of covering up data linking vaccines to autism, and appeared in the 2016 documentary Vaxxed, directed by Andrew Wakefield, author of a retracted, fraudulent study linking measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination to autism.

Kennedy’s Record
Kennedy earned huge fees as a lawyer suing HHS, in part on a program to compensate people injured by vaccines. Already as HHS secretary, he has pledged to investigate subjects that were “formally taboo or insufficiently scrutinized.” Among them, he said, was the childhood vaccine schedule.


To experts, Kennedy’s comments were puzzling given the vast amount of safety and efficacy data available about the vaccine schedule.

“These things have been studied until the cows go home,” said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine who has advised the CDC on vaccines.

Some health officials have also expressed concerns that Kennedy may not be bringing a sense of urgency to deal with the measles epidemic that’s resulted in the death of a child in Texas. When asked in a cabinet meeting last month, Kennedy said the situation is “not unusual, we have measles outbreaks every year.”

Experts disagree.

“I don’t understand why, as the US is currently battling several deadly outbreaks, HHS would take any action to undermine Americans’ confidence in or restrict their ability to access life-saving vaccines,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology at Brown University who advises governments on pandemic preparedness.

Changes to Vaccine Work
Under Kennedy’s leadership, HHS has also made subtle changes to its vaccine work. In February, the CDC terminated a successful ad campaign that encouraged people to get the flu shot. The move came as the US grapples with its worst flu season in over 15 years.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has laid off thousands of employees across federal health agencies, including hundreds at the CDC.

The CDC dispatched a team of experts to Texas after the state health department requested federal help tracking the measles outbreak. Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, said she was seeing parents who previously didn’t vaccinate their children start coming to the mobile clinics and take the virus seriously.

“The most important thing is to get the people who are unvaccinated, vaccinated,” she said.


To public health experts who worry that Weldon and Kennedy will erode trust in vaccines, the cases in Texas could be a sign of what’s to come.

“This is just the beginning,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist and research scientist at the University of Saskatchewan. “A lot of this misinformation is going to cause these outbreaks to be worse.”"
2025-03-13T12:07:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/trump-vows-200-tariff-on-eu-wine-escalating-trade-tensions,"President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 200% tariff on wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from France and elsewhere in the European Union, the latest escalation in a growing transatlantic trade war.

The president in a social media post on Thursday said that he would move forward with the import duties if Brussels follows through with a tax on American whiskey exports, a measure aimed at retaliating against Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs that went into effect on Wednesday.

“If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES,” Trump said about the pending levies on bourbon. “This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.”

Trump later Thursday said he would not repeal tariffs on steel and aluminum that took effect this week, nor back off plans for sweeping reciprocal tariffs on global trading parters set to start as soon as April 2.

“No,” the US president told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if he would pull back from tariffs. “We’ve been ripped off for years, and we’re not going to be ripped off anymore.”

A three-week selloff in US stocks resumed in force on Thursday, sending the S&P 500 Index to the brink of a 10% correction, as investors took stock of Trump’s latest tariff threats amid another benign inflation report.

Shares in European makers of alcoholic beverages fell earlier, with LVMH, which owns champagne houses Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot, down as much as 2.2%. Cognac producer Remy Cointreau SA dropped 4.5% and spirits maker Pernod Ricard declined 3.6%.

Trump is “escalating the trade war he chose to unleash,” Laurent Saint-Martin, France’s trade minister, wrote in a post on X. “We will not give in to threats and will always protect our industries.”

The US president on Thursday once again aired his grievances against the EU, this time citing its treatment of American tech companies.

“They’re suing Google, they’re suing Facebook, they’re suing all of these companies, and they’re taking billions of dollars out of American companies, many more than the ones I just mentioned. And I guess they’re using it to run Europe or something. I don’t know what they’re using it for, but they treat us very badly,” Trump said.

In response to Trump’s metals tariffs, the EU is planning countermeasures with duties on as much as €26 billion ($28.3 billion) worth of American products.

The EU will also immediately begin consultations with member states, with the aim of adopting the additional lists of agricultural and industrial goods subject to tariffs as high as 25% by mid-April.

“The president was totally annoyed that the Europeans did this,” US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg Television on Thursday. “He cares about America, and he wants to take care of Americans. And why are Europeans picking on Kentucky bourbon, Harley-Davidson motorcycles?”


Lutnick was referring to iconic American products that were tariff targets during Trump’s first-term trade dispute with the EU. Those duties were suspended under a Biden administration ceasefire that’s scheduled to end on March 31, and without a new deal or an extension, they’ll snap back into force at an even higher rate.

Talks Today
Lutnick, who said he plans to speak to EU officials later Thursday said that hopefully, “they’ll realize that they should take these things down.”

A spokesman for the EU confirmed that calls are planned.

Trump has also pledged yet another round of tariffs in just three weeks, saying he’ll begin rolling out so-called reciprocal duties. The White House plans to apply an across-the-board rate to each country, based on a calculation of their own tariffs and other trade barriers, such as digital taxes or value-added levies.

That threatens to further ignite the trade war, forcing countries to retaliate in ways that could spur Trump to add more levies of his own under the mantle of reciprocity. The president is also pledging separate sectoral tariffs on industries including autos, lumber, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and copper.

The president has enacted his sweeping tariff agenda in a piecemeal fashion, a strategy that has been punctuated by uncertainty, including delays, reversals and changes in direction. Trump on Tuesday threatened to double a forthcoming tariff on Canada and backed down hours later when Ontario paused an export surcharge on electricity.

The use of tariffs as leverage in economic and geopolitical disputes is weighing on markets. The S&P 500 Index has dropped nearly 10% from a February high, raising fears of a recession.

Trump — who during his first term repeatedly touted stock surges as validation of his policies — has shrugged off the fallout, saying this week the selloff was a buying opportunity and necessary to remake American industry and supply chains. Support for his tariff barrage is tepid at best, with many industry groups urging exemptions and economists warning of cascading fallout across the economy.


Trump during his first term pledged to enact sweeping tariffs on French wine over Paris’ tax posture toward US technology companies, but later retreated from that threat after he reached a truce with French President Emmanuel Macron."
2025-03-13T12:07:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/europe-feed-sector-sees-disruption-from-likely-tariff-on-us-soy,"Europe’s animal feed industry has warned of supply challenges if US soybeans are hit in the escalating trade war between Brussels and Washington.

European Union lawmakers are looking to target some €26 billion ($28.2 billion) worth of goods from the US after President Donald Trump imposed a 25% levy on steel and aluminum imports. The bloc will target politically sensitive goods in Republican-led states, including soybeans.

Such a move “may lead to the disruption of vital feed supply chains, as the EU will continue to rely on essential feed imports in particular for protein rich feed products like soybeans,” Pedro Cordero, president of European feed industry group Fefac, said in a statement this week.

Soybeans are typically crushed into cooking oil and turned into animal feed.

Europe is reliant on imports to bolster domestic supplies. It was the second largest export destination for US soybeans in 2024, buying some $2.4 billion worth, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture.

American farmers will also be watching out for additional challenges to exporting soybeans after top buyer China also retaliated against US tariffs with levies of its own on a slew of agri and food products. It also announced a complete suspension of soybean imports from three US entities.

While potential EU tariffs will be “unfavorable for exports to Europe,” said Thijs Geijer, a food and agriculture economist at ING, the increased trade tensions “will definitely put pressure on soybean plantings in the US given that it’s less economically feasible to have to sell soybeans to China next year compared to Brazil, the big competitor.”"

Potential US tarriffs and persistent global excess capacities could add to woes in the industry, Germany’s largest bank said in its annual report published Thursday.

Europe’s carmakers are bracing for major cost cuts after years of excess capacity and muted demand, particularly for electric vehicles. Increasing global trade tensions on the back of sweeping policy changes in the US have further complicated their situation.

In Germany, where around a third of Deutsche Bank’s exposure is, the stress has also affected automotive suppliers. These manufacturers generally operate on tight margins and their orders from major automakers can change relatively rapidly in response to shifting conditions.


Germany’s Distress Levels to Rise as Pain Subsides in Europe (1)

At Deutsche Bank, the volume of troubled loans to the auto industry — those at higher risk of default or already impaired — rose 17% last year, to €1.67 billion, the report showed. Allowances for credit losses increased 35%."

Cboe Global Market’s former head of exchange-traded products listings Robert Marrocco will join the Texas Stock Exchange as its global head of ETP listings, while Nasdaq’s former head of ETP listings Alison Hennessy will join as TXSE’s managing director of ETPs, according to a Thursday press release.

It’s a bold statement of intent by the Texas Stock Exchange. The market for ETF and ETP listings is dominated by three big exchange operators: the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Cboe. Competition for primary listings has become fiercer as hundreds of new ETFs launch each year, with ETFs now averaging nearly 30% of daily trading volume on exchanges, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The Texas Stock Exchange, which aims to start trading in early 2026, has singled out the ETF industry as a priority.

“I’m proud to welcome these proven ETP leaders to the Texas Stock Exchange,” James H Lee, TXSE chairman and CEO, said in the release. “The ETP market is growing at an unprecedented pace. The Texas Stock Exchange is committed to delivering the innovation, operational expertise, and alignment that sponsors require to capitalize on this next wave of global expansion.”


In addition, Kyle Murray, also formerly with Cboe, will become TXSE’s deputy general counsel and legal head of global listings, while Laura Morrison, Cboe’s former global head of ETPs, will join the exchange as a strategic adviser."
2025-03-13T12:21:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/canadian-auto-parts-stocks-thrown-into-a-tailspin-by-tariff-woes,"Canada’s biggest auto parts names are buckling under the weight of US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats as the chances the North American car manufacturing industry will stall grow. That’s sending stock prices hurtling back down toward levels last seen during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Shares of Martinrea International Inc. fell 1.1% on Wednesday, closing at their lowest since 2020 after the US put in place 25% tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel, both of which are key inputs for auto parts. Trump further fueled investors’ agita when he told reporters in the Oval Office that there would be very little flexibility on tariffs by April 2 — the day automotive levies against Canada are expected to take effect.

The nation’s largest auto-parts maker, Magna International Inc., hit a five-year low last Tuesday when Trump first enacted his 25% tariff on most Canadian goods. Shares of Linamar Corp. followed suit, dropping to the lowest since 2022. A small relief bump followed when Trump gave cars and auto parts covered under the current North American free trade agreement a one-month reprieve from the levy. But that was cut short this week and all three stocks are now down about 3% or more over the past three sessions, hovering near recent lows.

The trade war threatens to upend a highly-interconnected international supply chain that’s been in place for decades. Free trade deals — most recently the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement which Trump signed in 2018 — have made it possible to pass auto parts between the three countries multiple times in the construction of a vehicle. With tariffs and retaliatory tariffs in force, such a cross-border route would rack up levies that stack atop each other several times over.

“The way that we’re integrated now, it means that in only a few days the supply chain can stop functioning,” Francois-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s industry minister, said in French at a press conference Wednesday. In a few days, American factories needing Canadian parts could grind to a halt, he said.

Last week, Linamar’s Executive Chair Linda Hasenfratz told analysts piling metal tariffs on top of auto tariffs would “likely shut the industry down,” costing carmakers billions. But she said the country’s second-largest auto parts maker wouldn’t move any Canadian facilities to the US, calling the rapidly changing tariff policy “short-term tactics” that shouldn’t dictate long-term decisions.

Shares of the big three US automakers, while comfortably above pandemic lows, have sunk since Trump was elected. As of Wednesday’s close General Motors Co. and Stellantis NV are each down 11% while Ford Motor Co. has slumped 9.5% since Nov. 5.

“These companies — most of them — have long-standing commitments to this country,” Champagne said. “We’re going to make sure they abide by the terms of every single agreement we have with them to make sure we protect the jobs.”"
2025-03-13T12:23:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/chinese-mafia-ramps-up-euro-crime-in-multi-billion-fraud-spree,"Chinese organized crime syndicates are defrauding the European Union out of billions of euros in tax and customs revenue through sophisticated networks of fake companies that exploit regulatory blind spots, according to the EU’s chief public prosecutor.

“We see a lot of Chinese mafia activity,” Laura Kovesi said in an interview with Bloomberg, describing the groups as “very agile, flexible and highly organized.” According to a recent report by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, tax and customs fraud has cost the EU an estimated €13 billion ($14.1 billion).

The main target of these illicit networks are value-added taxes, known as VAT, which all EU member states are required to apply to goods and services consumed within the bloc. This levy, which must be at least 15%, is paid by buyers directly to businesses, which are in turn expected to remit that money to national tax authorities.

As VAT isn’t applied to cross-border sales within the EU, criminal groups have set up fake companies and elaborate logistical operations to dupe individual country authorities into not collecting the tax.


“They even have established their own underground banking system that allows for the repatriation of funds and for the channeling of money from China, to invest in more fraud,” Kovesi said. She refused to go into the details of the specific groups currently under investigation.

E-commerce is another popular avenue for fraud, as sellers outside the bloc have targeted an EU rule exempting goods worth less than €150 from import duties. Among other tactics, sellers are known to dismantle big-ticket items and ship them in separate packages to lower the stated value and circumvent customs.

In January, the EU published a report showing that the bloc’s tax gap — the difference between what governments theoretically should be collecting and what they actually collect — is about €90 billion a year. “To put it into perspective,” commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said in an interview with Bloomberg, “that is roughly half of the EU’s budget on a yearly basis.”

Of that €90 billion shortfall, the commission estimates that between €12.5 billion and €33 billion is lost to fraud.

President Donald Trump singled out Europe’s VAT rules recently as a potential trigger for reciprocal tariffs. Speaking to Bloomberg, the EU’s tax chief disagreed with that assessment, saying that value-added taxes should not be seen as tariffs.

For now, VAT fraud shows no sign of slowing down. In November, the biggest-ever VAT fraud case, nicknamed “Investigation Admiral,” culminated in raids across 16 EU countries. That scheme involved selling electronic goods via online marketplaces and is believed to have generated €2.9 billion in illicit profits. Just last week, prosecutors unveiled an investigation into a network of 29 Chinese-run companies in Florence, Prato and Rome accused of evading customs duties and VAT payments.


“They are very discreet,” Kovesi said of such operations. “But they are everywhere.”

EPPO investigations have exposed thousands of illicit companies located at logistical hubs across the EU. Officials have also discovered underground banking networks that criminal syndicates use to send money to China to be reinvested in fraud.

As the financial stakes have gotten higher, so too has the threat of violence, she added. “We have wiretaps of very nasty people planning murders because of VAT fraud, just like they would do for drugs.”"
2025-03-13T12:28:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/kazakhstan-s-kaspi-kz-nears-deal-for-rabobank-turkey-unit-after-past-bids-failed,"Fintech billionaire Vyacheslav Kim’s Kaspi.kz JSC is in talks to buy Rabobank Group’s Turkish unit, according to people with direct knowledge of the discussions, in what would be its second acquisition in the country.

The deliberations are ongoing and no final decisions have been made, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing confidential information. Any deal will be subject to approval from Turkish regulators, the people said.

The unit, Rabobank AS, had non-consolidated assets of $52 million as of December, according to Turkey’s Public Disclosure Platform.

Spokespeople for Rabobank Turkey and Kaspi.kz declined to comment. Representatives in Rabobank’s headquarters in Utrecht, Netherlands did not immediately return a request for comment.

The negotiations come after the Dutch firm’s failed attempts to sell the unit, first to cryptocurrency exchange BtcTurk and then to construction conglomerate Ronesans Holding.

The deal, if successful, will be Kaspi.kz’s second acquisition in Turkey in the past year. It purchased a majority stake in e-commerce platform Hepsiburada for $1.13 billion, which closed in January.


Kaspi.kz has been seeking opportunities in Turkey, betting that its “super app” model — merging banking, payments and e-commerce — can gain traction in a market of 85 million people. The firm has 14 million users out of Kazakhstan’s population of 20 million, and is the country’s most valuable public company.

Rabobank has been scaling back operations in countries where it lacks a strong presence. The Dutch cooperative bank, which specializes in food and agriculture financing, has also been streamlining its European portfolio."
2025-03-13T12:28:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/hugo-boss-sees-sluggish-us-china-demand-at-start-of-year,"Hugo Boss AG’s plan to return to profit growth this year faces an initial hurdle as weak consumer sentiment in the US and China weigh on sales and profit in the current quarter.

“We expect a muted first-quarter performance trending somewhat below our full-year top line guidance range,” Chief Executive Officer Daniel Grieder told journalists on a call.

The shares fell 5.3% by 1:17 p.m. Frankfurt time in an up-and-down session that earlier saw them rise as much as 4.7%. The stock has dropped about 35% in the last 12 months, a worse performance than rival high-end apparel makers Burberry Group Plc and Ralph Lauren Corp.

The German fashion house has been suffering since last year from a decline in consumer spending, which Grieder is trying to address with efficiency measures, such as shifting transport from air freight to ships. Job cuts are “not in our intention as we speak,” he said on the call.

In his nearly four-year tenure, Grieder revamped the Hugo and Boss brands with the goal of luring younger shoppers with more casual wear. His goals initially set out for 2025 — sales of €5 billion ($5.4 billion) and a profit margin of at least 12% — were delayed last year. But they are still doable, he said Thursday, without giving a specific time frame for reaching them.

The company expects earnings before interest and taxes of between €380 million and €440 million this year, it said, in line with analysts’ forecasts. The outlook for 2025 sales, however, came in just below the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

“The road ahead comes with several challenges that all pose tangible risk to consumer sentiment in 2025,” Grieder said, citing tariffs and the weak economic situation in China.

While the effect of tariffs imposed by the US administration is still unclear, Hugo Boss’s supply chain is flexible and sourcing from China has been reduced to below 5%, Chief Financial Officer Yves Müller said. The company doesn’t plan price increases at the moment, “but we have to see how it develops in the next few weeks and months,” Grieder said.

Asked about Frasers Group Plc, now the company’s largest shareholder, Grieder said the exchanges have been “very constructive.” The acquisitive sportswear-to-department-store retailer’s CEO, Michael Murray, is seeking a seat on Hugo Boss’s supervisory board at the May 15 annual meeting.

The risk of a criminal investigation into Grieder over media allegations of insider trading activities is over, with the German financial watchdog and a public prosecutor deciding after an initial examination that there was no sufficient evidence to launch such a procedure.

“This affair is behind us, it’s dealt with in a serious, transparent way,” Grieder said.

Hugo Boss intends to pay a dividend of €1.40 per share, above analysts estimate.

2025-03-13T12:32:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/us-producer-price-index-stalls-on-decline-in-services-costs,"US wholesale inflation stagnated in February thanks to a sharp decline in trade margins, though one measure of goods prices jumped and details were also less favorable for the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge.

The producer price index was unchanged from a month earlier following a revised 0.6% increase in January, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report released Thursday. Excluding food and energy, the PPI declined for the first time since July.

The index was weighed down by a 1% drop in trade services, a category which reflects changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers. Categories that inform the Fed’s preferred inflation measure — the personal consumption expenditures price index — were largely firmer, including a 1% increase in hospital inpatient care and a 0.5% rise in portfolio management costs.


Goods prices excluding food and energy also advanced by 0.4%, the most in more than two years.

The drop in margins “tentatively signals that consumers will be shielded from some of the forthcoming increase in manufacturers’ selling prices and import prices,” Samuel Tombs, the chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note.

“With consumers’ confidence weak and many people already having brought forwards purchases of durable goods, demand for goods will be very weak later this year, forcing retailers to accept thinner margins,” Tombs said.

Thursday’s data follow a BLS report Wednesday which showed consumer prices rose just 0.2% last month, the smallest increase since October. However, details from the CPI also pointed to a higher PCE price gauge when that figure is reported later this month, and economists are already looking ahead to the potential impact on prices this year of sweeping tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on the country’s largest trading partners.

Tariff Impact
In early February, the Trump administration put in place an additional 10% levy on goods imported from China. Details of the producer prices report showed robust increases in categories including iron and steel scrap, various types of machinery and household items like furniture, appliances and jewelry.

The PPI data also showed food prices rose 1.7% — the most in three months — amid an ongoing surge in egg prices. Energy costs declined 1.2%. The Bloomberg Commodity Index rose in mid-February to the highest level since 2023 before tumbling in the final week of the month amid a broader rout in financial markets.

A separate report Thursday showed little change in initial applications for jobless benefits last week, underscoring labor market resilience."
2025-03-13T12:32:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/republicans-urge-fed-to-alter-supplementary-leverage-ratio,"Five House Republicans urged Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to take steps to improve liquidity in the Treasury securities market, including considering “targeted” changes to bank capital requirements.

The $29 trillion market for US Treasuries has experienced instances of low liquidity over the past several years, including in early 2020 when the onset of Covid-19 caused a panic that nearly froze trading. That episode prompted the Fed to provide a backstop by buying billions of dollars in Treasuries per day.

Some investors and analysts have claimed such disruptions are linked to the supplementary leverage ratio, or SLR, which they say has deterred banks from acting as market makers.

“Though the market remains strong, it has undergone challenges,” the lawmakers wrote. “Most notably, the volume of US debt has dramatically increased while the capacity of dealers to provide liquidity to the market has been reduced.”

The Fed declined to comment.

The letter was led by Representative Frank Lucas of Oklahoma, chair of a new task force that will examine how to improve the Treasury market’s functioning along with Fed monetary policy and bank regulation.

The lawmakers in the letter asked the Fed Board of Governors to solicit public comment on improvements to the supplementary leverage ratio and the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio in order to “improve liquidity in the Treasury market.”

“We urge the board to assess targeted changes,” they added.

The SLR was introduced in the US in 2014 as part of the Basel III reforms to banking regulation agreed to by central banks in a host of developed-market countries. It requires financial institutions to hold capital against their portfolios, including inventories of Treasuries. The so-called enhanced SLR forced the largest and most interconnected banks to meet an even higher capital threshold.

Powell expressed support for reducing the SLR during congressional testimony last month.

“That’s something I do expect we will return to and work on with our new colleagues at the other agencies and get done,” Powell said."

Initial claims decreased by 2,000 to 220,000 in the week ended March 8. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 225,000 applications.

Continuing claims, a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, fell to 1.87 million in the week ended March 1, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. That was also lower than forecast.

The labor market has remained resilient so far in the face of uncertainty around the Trump administration’s escalating trade wars and shrinking of the federal government.

Applications filed by out-of-work federal employees aren’t included in total claims. In the week ended March 1, the latest available for this category, claims remained elevated for a second week. The number will be updated later on Thursday.

The four-week moving average of new applications, a metric that helps smooth out fluctuations from week-to-week, rose to 226,000, the highest in almost three months.

Before adjusting for seasonal factors, initial claims declined, led by a large decrease of almost 15,000 in New York.

Separate data released Thursday showed wholesale inflation stagnated in February, helped by a decline in services costs, although details for the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge were less favorable."

The greenback advanced against most of its Group-of-10 peers on Thursday, helping the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index stabilize after a more than 3% slump this quarter on concern that a trade war will weigh on the US economy.

Now, options traders are starting to position for a rebound in the greenback, with so-called risk reversals — a gauge of appetite for options that benefit from a rise or fall in a currency — increasingly favoring dollar strength. That’s despite speculative traders, including hedge funds and asset managers, reducing their bets on the dollar to the lowest since October, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission through March 4.

“A stabilization might be on the cards for now” for the dollar, said Francesco Pesole, a currency strategist at ING Bank NV. “In the coming weeks, we still see upside risks for the greenback.”

Some technical signals used by the market to identify turning points in an asset price also support the idea of a dollar rebound.

A gauge of momentum known as the Commodity Channel Index, which compares a currency’s price to its statistical average in order to identify when a move has gone too far, is signaling that the dollar is a buy; such signals have captured six periods of greenback strength over the past 10 months.

And, on Friday, a separate indicator — the so-called DeMark Buy Countdown, which tracks a market trend’s strength and its likelihood of reversing — hit a level viewed by some market participants as a sign the currency will rebound within the next 12 days. When that signal last triggered in December 2022, Bloomberg’s dollar gauge rallied more than 1% within a week.

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has been trading near its 200-daily moving average for the last week without definitively breaching it to head lower — or bouncing back."
2025-03-13T12:38:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/estonia-joins-calls-on-eu-to-delay-new-carbon-market-for-fuels,"Estonia joined other European Union nations in urging the bloc to delay or even scrap a new carbon market for transportation and heating fuels, on concerns it could boost energy costs.

While Estonia supports EU climate goals, it sees a risk that the new program could boost fuel prices and put household and business budgets under pressure. The country wants to examine alternative options to drive emissions reductions in the buildings and transport sectors first, according to Prime Minister Kristen Michal.

“We are starting consultations with the European Commission and member states with the wish to postpone the launch of the new carbon market and — if possible and if we have the votes — then we will try to cancel it,” the premier said at a press conference in Tallinn on Thursday.

The Estonian leader’s comments highlight the multiple challenges facing the EU to stay on track in the push to make the bloc’s economy greener, while also boosting spending on defense and delivering on a pledge to cut persistently high energy prices that have badly hurt economies like Germany.

The new program, known as Emissions Trading System 2, is due to begin in 2027 as a key tool to help the EU reduce greenhouse gases by at least 55% by the end of the decade, compared with 1990 levels.

The plan has already come under criticism from Poland, which wants to delay it to 2030 amid concerns that carbon costs will further inflate energy prices. Politicians in Slovakia and the Czech Republic have also urged a delay."
2025-03-13T12:40:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/arctic-weather-blast-to-put-strain-on-europe-s-energy-systems,"A blast of Arctic air will bring icy temperatures and low wind speeds to Europe over the next week, putting pressure on energy systems already struggling with depleted natural gas inventories.

There are warnings for ice and snow across parts of the UK, France, Germany and Spain. The temperature in cities like London and Paris — which soared close to 20C (68F) last weekend — will dip below zero on Friday. That will push up power demand just as generation from solar and wind drop — a combination known as “Dunkelflaute.”

The frigid air is being pulled in by high pressure to the south of Iceland, according to Honor Criswick, a meteorologist at the UK’s Met Office. “Through the rest of the week it’s going to get even colder,” she said.

Europe is facing a challenging stockpiling season after higher gas usage this winter caused rapid withdrawals from storage sites, pushing reserves to the lowest levels since 2022. That will make it harder to replenish inventories when the heating season ends on March 31, especially as summer contracts are more expensive than for the following winter.

The cold front is forecast to tamp down wind power generation in the UK and Germany this week, according to analysis by Matthew Dobson, a meteorologist with the weather analytics firm Met Desk. The conditions also likely mean poor solar energy production across parts of Germany, France and Italy, he said, though skies are expected to be clearer in the UK and the Netherlands.

Solar levels in Germany are set to plunge by more than half from last week’s daily peak of 40 gigawatts, which equated to about two-thirds of the power output of France’s fleet of nuclear reactors.

Still, wind and solar generation are forecast to rebound somewhat next week, Dobson said.

The freezing weather could foreshadow another cold snap later this month or in early April. A band of high-altitude Arctic winds known as the polar vortex recently collapsed, triggering a “severe stratospheric warming” event on March 8, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.

This high-altitude warming — which happens around this time every year — often frees up a band of Arctic air and a high-pressure system that weeks later drags a cold wave across Europe. Another cold blast isn’t guaranteed, but it happens about 70% of the time, the Met Office’s Criswick said.

“The forecast is showing hints of this happening,” she said.

The prospect of cold periods in March has been in the cards for weeks, but forecast models have seesawed, partly because of uncertainty around the timing and impact of the polar vortex’s collapse."

“If you make him unhappy, he responds unhappy,” Lutnick said of Trump’s move Thursday to slap a 200% tariff on European Union alcohol products in reaction to the EU’s retaliation against new US steel and aluminum duties.

Trump’s intention is to “break down those walls” preventing American products from coming in, and to build manufacturing capacity in industries crucial to national security, Lutnick said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Countries that understand that motive and are open to working with the US will get different treatment, he said.

“The British didn’t respond, the Mexicans didn’t respond — you have some countries that actually thoughtfully examine how they do business with us,” Lutnick said. For those nations that “go right back to old-school” tit-for-tat measures “the president’s going to deal with them with strength and with power,” he said.

Lutnick also said that Canada’s retaliatory measures against US tariff hikes were done out of domestic political considerations, as the American neighbor heads toward elections.

“You think it’s about a trade war — this is their way of getting election votes,” Lutnick said."

The stock dropped 9.1% to 40.10 shillings in Nairobi after dropping as much as 21%, the most intraday since 2007. The 3-shilling-a-share dividend that the company declared Wednesday was below the average estimate of 3.83 shillings from three analysts.

KCB on Wednesday reported a 66% jump in 2024 profit, the fastest growth in three years. The dividend is equal to about 16% of the bank’s earnings per share last year.

“The shareholders are not happy,” according to Ronny Chokaa, senior research analyst at Capital A Investment Bank. “One-year treasury bills are at 10% but they’re giving a dividend yield of 6.7% — I think shareholders can’t take that kindly.”

Kenya’s Biggest Bank Profit Jumps 66% as Interest Income Rises

The Nairobi-based bank is building a pipeline to fund future projects including expansion plans into markets like Ethiopia that are opening up, Chief Finance Officer Lawrence Kimathi said in an interview.

“There are a number of considerations that we’ve looked at by the time we arrived at the final dividends - the capital requirements for some of our subsidiaries, some of the deals that are in the pipeline that I can talk about which will require investment capital,” he said.

The lender is awaiting approval from the Central Bank of Kenya on the sale of National Bank of Kenya to Nigeria’s Access bank, he said.

The ex-employee filed a claim in a German court in the second quarter of last year, the Frankfurt-based bank said in its annual report published Thursday, without naming the person.

Five other former Deutsche Bank employees involved in the Monte Paschi case also threatened to bring their own claims in an English court, the bank said.

In the original case, Monte Paschi managers were accused of colluding with Deutsche Bank staff to hide losses at the Italian lender by using complex derivatives trades, leading to a misrepresentation of the firm’s finances between 2008 and 2012.

After a conviction at the first instance in 2019, the six Deutsche Bank staff were fully acquitted in 2022 by a Milan appeals court which found that there were no grounds for trial. In October 2023, Italy’s supreme court upheld the acquittal, which is now therefore final.

Deutsche Bank considers the claims “to be entirely without merit and will defend itself against them robustly, including disputing inflated, unrealistic alleged losses.” Deutsche Bank said it isn’t disclosing whether it has established a provision or contingent liability as it could affect the outcome of the proceedings."

The 15 largest European members of the alliance may need to ramp up investment by as much as $340 billion to $720 billion annually, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote in a report released Thursday.

“Based on lessons learned from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, European NATO needs include at least $200 billion in armor and aircraft from companies such as BAE Systems, Airbus, Boeing, Saab and General Dynamics,” wrote lead analyst George Ferguson.

That call comes as US President Donald Trump has signaled his intention to dial back US security commitments in Europe and demanded allies boost their defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product. US security support to Europe is so significant that the continent’s defenses risk faltering in weeks without it, Bloomberg News reported.

According to the report, large-scale rearmament will be slowed down by contractors’ huge backlogs, with supply chains already stretched by existing demand.


Europe’s smaller defense industry probably won’t be able to supply all that’s needed in the near to medium term, the report said, adding that the sector also faces a shortage of trained personnel to meet future needs.

The European Union has been shocked into action by Trump’s abrupt foreign policy shifts and has proposed extending €150 billion in loans to boost defense spending.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU also plans measures to allow countries to use national budgets to spend an additional €650 billion on defense over four years without triggering penalties for excessive budget deficits.

“These loans should finance purchases from European producers, to help boost our own defense industry,” von der Leyen told the European Parliament on Tuesday, suggesting non-EU companies would be included but stopped short of an outright exclusion of big external defense suppliers such as the US.

The continent’s defense sector would first need “firm commitments” in the form of long-term procurement contracts if it is to ramp up production capacity, Jan Pie, Secretary General of the Aerospace, Security and Defense Industries’ Association of Europe said in a statement last week.

He suggested demand aggregation and similar requirements of European nations would reduce times and prices, making a strong case for “buying European,” a key debate in defense procurement among member states."

“Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, we see renewed interest in sustainable finance from the public and private sectors,” said Anne-Marie Chidzero, chief investment officer for FSD Africa Investments.

US President Donald Trump’s retreat from action against climate change has placed funding under scrutiny, though analysts voiced optimism that other sources of support will fill the gap.

“We see a potential to catalyze about $300 million in climate finance through the capital markets,” Chidzero said. FSD Africa, which is based in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, raised 220 million pounds ($285 million) in 2023-2024 for climate projects in Africa."

The National Treasury on Wednesday proposed hiking value-added tax by 1 percentage point by mid-2026, increasing fuel levies and not adjusting tax brackets to account for inflation.

The revenue and expenditure plan won backing from the African National Congress, the largest political party, the Inkatha Freedom Party, GOOD and the Patriotic Alliance. But the Democratic Alliance, uMkhonto weSizwe Party, Economic Freedom Fighters, Freedom Front Plus and three smaller parties that jointly have 201 of the 400 seats in the legislature said they will vote against the measure unless amendments are made.

Lawmakers in South Africa typically vote along party lines. Some smaller parties haven’t taken a position on the budget or weren’t immediately available for comment.


The DA, which is the second-biggest party and forms part of South Africa’s ruling coalition, wants the Treasury to do more to revive economic growth and commit to a comprehensive spending review within a specified time frame, according to its leader, John Steenhuisen.

Godongwana has indicated he’s prepared to make concessions, but said differences over the budget need to be resolved at a political level as those discussions fall beyond the Treasury’s purview. He said the DA objected to the budget because it suffered a number of recent political losses, including failing to block the declaration of a new land-expropriation law.

“Rejecting a budget on its own is not a problem. What is a problem” is how the DA have gone about it, he said at a post-budget event hosted by media company News24 on Thursday.

The budget will be interrogated by parliamentary committees whereupon lawmakers will debate allocations made to the various government departments and entities before the National Assembly votes on whether to approve it in May. That should leave sufficient time for a compromise to be reached that leaves the ruling alliance intact.

“While the DA is using the budget process as leverage to extract concessions, it currently has no intention of leaving the government,” said Amaka Anku, head of risk advisory service Eurasia Group’s Africa practice. “That limits the threat to the stability of the government.”"
2025-03-13T13:00:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/deportation-push-sows-hidden-risks-in-wall-street-s-debt-machine,"Marcelo Rodriguez is in the middle of a chain of lending that has connected Wall Street to New York’s Spanish-speaking community, providing a lifeline to vulnerable borrowers including the undocumented. That lifeline is now starting to fray.

For years, his company, InQmatic, has connected small-business owners with firms that are willing to bankroll risky loans, some of which are then bundled into securities and sold off by big banks. The lenders rarely seemed to put much effort into vetting applicants’ immigration status, Rodriguez said — until recently.

“Now,” he said, “they make it clear that their preference is for borrowers to be citizens.”

The shift is a byproduct of President Donald Trump’s push to, as he’s vowed repeatedly, carry out “the largest deportation operation in American history.” And it reveals how the chilling effect triggered by that plan is spreading fast — far faster than the actual pickup in deportations — and threatening the finances of many undocumented immigrants.

It also underscores the growing dilemma that firms specializing in lending to people with checkered, or no, credit history — a group that includes many of the nation’s 14 million undocumented people — now face, even as many fintechs have made courting the unbanked a key priority in recent years. The problem is twofold: first, these lenders don’t want to risk running afoul of an administration that has made clamping down on illegal immigration a key objective. And second, they don’t want to be in the position of having to write off a loan made unpayable if a borrower is deported.

By tapping a network of credit unions, non-profits, fintechs and payday lenders, foreign-born undocumented immigrants accounted for some $10 billion in interest payments and other financial transactions excluding mortgages in 2023, according to an estimate by Financial Health Network, a nonprofit that focuses on the financial education of consumers.

Auto loans, in particular, stand out in this category. Many undocumented immigrants work in sectors such as hospitality, agriculture and construction and need cars to get to work. And unlike mortgages or consumer loans, which tend to be underwritten by banks that are subject to regulations such as the Bank Secrecy Act, auto loans to customers with lower or no credit scores are frequently underwritten by finance companies and require less documentation.

Some lenders raise cash by turning to banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank, which bundle their loans into asset-backed securities that in turn are sold to investment companies that manage money on behalf of millions of Americans’ retirement accounts, pensions, or even savings accounts.

To be clear, undocumented immigrants can legally obtain loans. Even if borrowers don’t have a Social Security number, they may be required to have identification for tax-paying purposes. And while Trump’s push may make the status of these loans more precarious, analysts doubt there are enough of them to have a broad effect in the more than $700 billion market for asset-backed securities, whether or not deportations accelerate as pledged.

Still, it adds to risks. What happens if borrowers are simply deported from the country? Will they continue to pay their loans?

“There are some pockets of heavy exposure, particularly for some auto lenders,” said Boris Peresechensky, a portfolio manager at Orange Investment Advisors. “And given the limited visibility into borrowers’ backgrounds, it’s hard to say how widespread the risk may be.”

Disclosure documents already flag the risks posed to particular securities backed by loans originated by at least half a dozen companies. That includes those tied to the auto lenders First Help Financial and Tricolor Auto Group, which each cater to customers with lower-than-average or middling credit scores and explicitly focus on extending loans to immigrants.

First Help says it focuses on financing working-class immigrants from Central and South America. It makes those loans through a network of over 2,400 dealers around the US, and as of last year was providing around $800 million worth of auto financing per year, according to bond rating documents. For $240 million in auto loan-backed bonds it sold this month, just over a quarter out of the roughly 4,150 borrowers it financed had Social Security numbers, according to a bond-ratings report.


The company’s borrowers include people like Adriana, 46, who moved from Ecuador over a decade ago and is undocumented. She and her husband, who live in New Jersey with their two children and own a construction business, are on the hook for a $30,000 loan they obtained from First Help in 2021 to help finance their Toyota Tundra pickup truck.

Like many other auto-loan companies, First Help uses asset-backed securities to effectively sell packages of auto loans like Adriana’s to end investors on Wall Street. For example, in October it issued $281 million of bonds backed by customers with middling or no credit scores, small pieces of which were purchased by dozens of investment firms including Columbia Threadneedle and Fidelity Investments.

First Help has warned its own investors about risks that they face if the nation’s immigration policies were to change. Customers like Adriana demonstrate that risk in real time. If she’s deported, she’d have much bigger things to worry about than repaying auto loan debt. More broadly, experts flag the threat of economic, financial and societal disruptions from large-scale deportations.

“I’m overwhelmed,” said Adriana, who declined to share her last name. “But this is a time to be strong.”

First Help is owned by the Treacy family and run by a former consultant at Boston Consulting Group, Pushan Sen Gupta. The company didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Lending Surge
Another lender is Texas-based auto dealer and finance company Tricolor. Partly owned by BlackRock Inc., it has sold asset-backed securities worth at least $1.6 billion since its first such deal in 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Texas-based Tricolor, which has focused much of its business on the low-income Hispanic community in states such as Texas, California and Nevada, estimates that over two-thirds of its borrowers are undocumented, based on having no Social Security number. Its lending has surged to about $1 billion of auto loans each year, close to five times its volume in 2020, according to a KBRA report.


“Nearly 10% of the entire workforce in California and Texas – our two primary markets – is undocumented,” said Tricolor Chief Executive Officer Daniel Chu in an emailed statement. “Our purpose is to provide them with high quality, reliable vehicles at affordable rates and set them on a path to better financial health.”

Auto loans aren’t the only lending product that face fresh risks under Trump. On the campaign trail, the now-president also pledged to ban mortgages for undocumented immigrants, which are generally provided by lenders in a nationwide patchwork that includes mortgage providers, credit unions and community development financial institutions. But mortgages are more heavily regulated than auto loans or other types of debt, and ultimately this market is small, with just 5,000 to 6,000 mortgages made to holders of Individual Tax Identification numbers in 2023, according to estimates from the Urban Institute.

So far, the Trump administration appears to be falling short on its goals. Last month, the top two deportation officials at US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were demoted and transferred amid the agency’s failure to meet daily arrest quotas.

Tricolor’s Chu said he’s doubtful that the administration’s deportations will be broad enough to have a major impact on the risks of its loans. He said the majority of his clients have been working in the country for years, making them less likely to be affected as officials prioritize those with criminal records.


“Our borrowers positively impact the US economy, having resided in the country for an average of 15 years and filling employment gaps in key industries like agriculture and other occupations emphasizing manual labor,” he said.

But the talk of a widening dragnet has been unsettling to people like Adriana. If she’s deported, she has a plan for her children: She and her husband would transfer legal authority over them to her brother-in-law, a US citizen.

“I don’t want my kids to go to a shelter,” she said.

As for Rodriguez at InQmatic, he has shifted his attention to working with borrowers who do have documentation. As many as one third of his prospective borrowers are undocumented — and as many as half of his borrowers from the construction sector are undocumented. Recently, his success rate in finding willing lenders for them has dropped nearly to zero.

“We used to work with some large lenders quite frequently,” said Rodriguez. “Now, it’s harder and harder to get them to agree.”"
2025-03-13T13:00:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/ai-companies-embrace-efficient-models-that-run-on-fewer-chips,"Nearly two months after the viral success of China’s DeepSeek prompted a reckoning over how much tech companies spend to develop artificial intelligence systems, some leading AI firms are embracing a less-is-more approach.

On Thursday, Toronto-based Cohere Inc. is set to announce a new model called Command A that can carry out complicated business tasks while running on just two of Nvidia Corp.’s AI-focused A100 or H100 chips. That’s significantly less than the number of chips required for some large models — and also less than what DeepSeek’s system is thought to need.

A day earlier, Alphabet Inc.’s Google unveiled a new series of its Gemma AI models that it said can run on a single Nvidia H100 chip. Both companies said their models rivaled or outperformed DeepSeek’s most recent AI system on certain tasks.

AI companies, including Google, continue to invest billions of dollars in data centers, chips and talent to develop their most cutting-edge models and support widespread adoption of them. But the recent launches also hint at an industrywide push to make AI software that can run as efficiently as possible. While some of these projects, including Cohere’s new model, were set in motion before DeepSeek’s most recent launch, the frenzy around the Chinese upstart may only accelerate this broader effort.

In January, DeepSeek released open-source AI software that rivaled models from OpenAI and Google — and was purportedly built at a fraction of the cost of competitors’ models. DeepSeek’s team came up with some simple but key innovations, such as finding ways to get more use from the computer chips they had access to.

Some AI executives argue the immense attention on DeepSeek is a positive for the industry, indicating it may be cheaper to roll out advanced AI systems than was commonly thought.


“I think the service DeepSeek did was make the market aware of how inefficient many players have been,” Aidan Gomez, Cohere’s co-founder and chief executive officer, said in an interview. “It was a very healthy wakeup call.”

Cohere said it began work on the new model eight months ago, before DeepSeek upended the tech world. For Cohere, which focuses on business uses of AI and was most recently valued at $5.5 billion, there’s an added benefit to this approach. Running AI models on fewer chips is “crucial” for business customers, who may have limited access to computing power.

“They don’t have tens, let alone hundreds, of GPUs to be able to deploy against problems,” Gomez said, referring to graphics processing units. “So they need a very light and scalable form factor.”"

The companies struck a two-year deal that leverages SoFi’s loan-platform business, which both originates loans on behalf of third parties and refers pre-qualified borrowers to origination partners, according to a statement Thursday. The business originated $2.1 billion of loans last year, the firm said.

“This represents the largest single commitment for SoFi’s Loan Platform Business and is two times our first commitment, enabling us to help more members get their money right while also diversifying toward less capital-intensive and fee-based sources of revenue,” SoFi Chief Executive Officer Anthony Noto said in the statement.

Their first summit since 2018, held in Cape Town on Thursday, comes just weeks after the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas lent support to South Africa’s presidency of the Group of 20 this year after US State and Treasury secretaries embarrassed the country by skipping G-20 gatherings last month.

Trump has frozen aid to South Africa accusing it of seizing private land, something that hasn’t happened since the end of White-minority rule in 1994. He has also hit the EU, along with other nations, with trade tariffs and stoked concern that Europe can no longer rely on Washington for military protection.

That new reality, according to Western diplomats Bloomberg spoke to, is warming relations which had cooled between the two after South Africa failed to clearly condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and moved closer to it and China as part of the BRICS alliance.

‘Shared Belief’
“In a moment of increased global confrontation and competition, we must strengthen our partnership further,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the summit. “We must work closely together, to ensure the future is built on our shared belief in cooperation and human dignity.”

The EU plans to mobilize €4.7 billion ($5.1 billion) for investment in South Africa that will include money for green energy as well as for the manufacture of vaccines in the country, she said in her opening remarks.

It also plans to start talks with South Africa over a Clean Trade and Investment Partnership that could boost the production of metals needed for the energy transition and green hydrogen, a clean-burning fuel that’s seen as possible alternative to natural gas in the future.

“In stable relations we stay together the course,” Von der Leyen said. “We give predictability and reliability.”

South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is hosting the gathering, separately lauded the importance of the EU as a development, trade and investment partner for his country.

“This summit is taking place at a time of global uncertainty characterised by rising unilateralism, economic nationalism and a retreat from international law and human rights,” he said. “We welcome the European Union’s support for multilateral institutions and the fundamental principles of the United Nations.”


The warm language contrasts with the previously ambivalent attitude of South African politicians toward the EU, which collectively is its second-biggest trade partner after China.

European diplomats stationed in Pretoria, who had struggled to get the attention of South African ministers, said there has been a thawing in relations in recent months. They asked not to be identified as they aren’t permitted to discuss confidential government relations.

Local politicians have previously accused Europe of using South Africa as a green transition “guinea pig” in a $9.3 billion climate-finance pact to wean the country off a reliance on coal. The US last month withdrew its pledge of $1 billion in loans toward the program.

“Whatever differences there were I feel that they are in the past,” Kallas told reporters in Johannesburg on Feb. 20 when asked about frictions between the EU and South Africa.

The summit is part of a strategic partnership agreed between South Africa and the EU in 2007, making the country the only one on the continent with a pact of this kind with the bloc.

Summits were held every year between 2009 and 2013, but took a five-year break until 2018 during the tenure of South Africa’s then-president, Jacob Zuma, under whom South Africa joined BRICS and formed closer relations with Russia and China."
2025-03-13T13:06:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/us-treasuries-fall-as-investors-look-past-data-to-tariff-risks,"Investors flocked to US government bonds Thursday as ebbing expectations for American economic growth weighed on stocks.

The rally averted a third straight daily loss that had appeared likely as 10- and 30-year yields reached their highest levels so far this month. Bond investors this week have mostly ignored US economic data showing slower inflation, viewing it as temporary because of the Trump administration’s trade policy.

“Treasuries have done a nice job buffering against drawdowns in equities,” Ed Al-Hussainy, global rates strategist at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. “That’s a really good sign for investors. It’s a sign diversifying out of stocks to Treasuries is still working. That’s a big deal.”

Expectations that the unfolding trade war also may dent the US economy have sent US equity benchmarks to six-month lows and stoked demand for bonds. Economists at Barclays Plc on Thursday lowered their forecast for US GDP this year and predicted two Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year versus one previously, even as they also see tariffs boosting inflation.

Treasury yields moved even lower beginning in the early New York afternoon session as major US equity benchmarks slumped. The 10-year yield fell about five basis points to 4.26% after rising in the morning to as high as 4.35%.

Earlier Thursday, Treasuries failed to sustain a positive reaction to data showing US wholesale inflation stagnated in February, helped by a decline in services costs. The producer price index was unchanged from January and up 3.2% compared with a year earlier.

The ongoing tariff threats are “stoking concerns about future inflation and renewed potential for higher policy rates for longer,” said Zachary Griffiths, head of investment-grade and macroeconomic strategy at CreditSights. “It will all come down to either affirmation of a slowing economy or data to the contrary to determine if the 10-year yield breaks sustainably below 4.25% — or if the new range is about 4.25% to 4.75% for now.”

Swaps traders expect the Fed will reduce interest rates this year by around 66 basis points. That implies at least two quarter-point rate cuts, with the first fully priced in by July.

The market’s recovery trimmed the expected yield for an auction of 30-year Treasury bonds at 1 p.m. New York time. Despite tepid demand metrics for the auction, yields subsequently declined further along with equity benchmarks.

Dominic Konstam, head of macro strategy at Mizuho Securities USA, says growing concern of a looming US recession that will force the Fed to cut rates aggressively later this year is driving yields lower.

“It could be a nasty looking recession in terms of jobs and GDP,” Konstam said. “And it means the Fed will have to cut rates a lot.”"
2025-03-13T13:07:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/white-house-to-withdraw-weldon-nomination-for-top-job-at-cdc,"The Trump administration withdrew the nomination of Dave Weldon for the top job at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as it grew clear there were not enough Senate votes to confirm him.

Weldon, a physician and vaccine critic, was set to go before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on Thursday morning. The HELP committee canceled the hearing less than an hour before it was set to begin.

Afterward, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who leads the committee, said “there were not the votes” to confirm Weldon.

Weldon’s interviews with Republican staff ahead of the hearing didn’t go well, according to a person familiar with the process. Weldon seemed to lack vision or direction for the agency, the person said. Earlier, Bloomberg had reported that Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine had expressed concerns about his views on vaccines.

He has previously spread debunked theories linking childhood vaccination to autism. As head of the CDC, Weldon would have been in charge of the vaccine schedule doctors typically follow to administer shots to kids.

Weldon, 71, has promoted the idea that a once-common vaccine preservative has links to childhood autism. Weldon recently told Senator Patty Murray in a prehearing meeting that children may be exposed to toxic levels of mercury through the government’s recommended immunization schedule. But the mercury-based preservative, thimerosal, was removed from childhood vaccines in the US in 2001.

After Weldon’s nomination was withdrawn, Murray said the Trump administration should choose a new nominee “who at bare minimum believes in basic science and will help lead CDC’s important work to monitor and prevent deadly outbreaks.”

Last-Minute Cancellation
The nomination hearing’s cancellation came so late that a line of people waiting outside the hearing room had already formed. Committee staff told them the hearing would be canceled around 9:20 a.m., less than an hour before it was supposed to begin.

One Republican senator on the committee, Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, said he only found out that the nomination was pulled minutes before arriving for the hearing.

Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who’s been a swing Republican vote on some of President Donald Trump’s more controversial nominations, said he had not privately met with Weldon and was undecided on whether he would have supported him.

“I wasn’t a hard yes, I was subject to his response to what I think would have been some pretty tough questions,” Tillis said in the Capitol on Thursday. “I don’t like people to say vaccines are scary and risky, because the people that get hurt the most are people that grew up like me, where they don’t have a lot of information.”

“We’re both doctors. He understands the importance of immunization,” Cassidy said of Weldon.

In a statement to the New York Times, Weldon said he was informed that his nomination was being withdrawn Wednesday night. He also said he intended to investigate the CDC’s conclusion that a preservative called thimerosal did not cause harm, and defended debunked claims questioning the safety of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.

“The president is a busy man doing good work for our nation and the last thing he needs is controversy about the CDC,” the statement reads.

Measles Backdrop
The US is currently suffering from a measles epidemic that’s already been linked to two deaths. Less than three full months into the year, the nation’s confirmed cases are approaching the 285 cases reported in all of 2024.

The withdrawal of Weldon’s nomination didn’t ease some health experts’ concerns, as he could have joined Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as a powerful voice sowing doubt about the safety of vaccines.

“One possibility is that the Senate is becoming very sensitive to the negative press that’s surrounding all of RFK Jr.’s antivax activity and they didn’t want more of it,” said Paul Offit, a vaccine expert and professor of pediatrics at the Children’s Hospital Philadelphia. “The second possibility is they’re just going to pick another anti-vaccine, science-denying conspiracy theorist.”

Nonetheless Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University Law Center, called the decision to withdraw Weldon’s nomination “a triumph of public health.”

“He’s fomented distrust in vaccines and propagated a conspiracy theory of the link between vaccines and autism that is utterly unacceptable,” Gostin said, calling him “utterly” unqualified for the role.

Earlier Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration’s top lawyer resigned two days after her appointment was announced, the agency posted on the social media site X.


Hilary Perkins, who joined the Department of Justice during Trump’s first administration, had come under fire from Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who posted on X that Marty Makary, Trump’s nominee for FDA commissioner, was “attempting to sneak a Biden abortion lawyer into top leadership at FDA.”

The nomination withdrawal was first reported by Axios.
A spokesperson for Senator Cassidy said the White House decision to pull the nomination did not come at Cassidy’s request.

In a conversation with Bloomberg earlier this month, Cassidy said he was not concerned about Weldon’s views on vaccines.

2025-03-13T13:11:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/dutch-coalition-parties-meet-amid-rift-over-defense-spending,"Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof convened an emergency meeting Thursday with the leaders of the coalition parties as they split over the European Union’s latest defense spending proposals.

The meeting, dubbed a “crisis” by Dutch public broadcaster NOS, was sparked by a Dutch parliament vote on Tuesday that backed a non-binding resolution opposing the bloc’s plan to mobilize as much as €800 billion ($869 billion) in defense spending in the coming years.

EU leaders are gathering for a summit next week to discuss European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s rearmament plan. As US President Donald Trump has signaled he’s backing away from Europe, von der Leyen said the extra spending is needed to boost European capabilities in areas such as air and missile defense, artillery systems, missiles and ammunition.

The plan has driven a new wedge through the already fragile Dutch coalition government. The far-right Freedom Party that heads the coalition and is led by lawmaker Geert Wilders, is opposed to using new EU joint debt to fund loans for defense spending or relaxing the EU’s fiscal rules for national budgets. Two of the other four parties in the coalition — the Farmer-Citizen Movement and New Social Contract — are also opposed.

While the vote was non-binding, it complicates Schoof’s ability to proceed with talks at the bloc level. He has already agreed to “the outlines” of the EU defense plan on behalf of the Netherlands, NOS said. Schoof, a former intelligence chief, was a non-political, compromise choice to serve as premier.

“It is very clear that Europe must do more for its own security,” Schoof said in a post on X during an emergency EU summit in Brussels last week."
2025-03-13T13:16:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/merz-defends-germany-s-spending-plan-as-crunch-vote-approaches,"Friedrich Merz faced attacks over his credibility as the prospective German chancellor seeks to fast-track hundreds of billions of euros in spending.

Lawmakers from across the political spectrum took the opportunity to lambaste Merz for seeking to push through a debt-fueled financing package before the new parliament is seated. The conservative leader defended his plans as a necessary response to the weakening transatlantic alliance under US President Donald Trump.

“Germany must return to the international stage as an effective partner in NATO, in Europe and in the world,” Merz said on Thursday during a testy parliamentary debate in Berlin. “The word ‘deterrence’ must now quickly be given a military definition; any delay would be irresponsible.”

In a high-risk maneuver, German lawmakers from an outgoing parliament have been recalled after an election for the first time this century. Merz wants the old Bundestag to pass constitutional changes that would ease borrowing restrictions for defense spending and establish a €500 billion ($543 billion) debt-financed infrastructure fund.

The conservative leader reconvened the lower house of parliament because getting the two-thirds majority needed for major decisions will be more difficult after the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, and the anti-capitalist Left gained support in the Feb. 23 election.

The final vote on the spending plan is set for Tuesday — exactly one week before the new parliament starts — and it’s still unclear whether Merz will be able to muster the super majority he needs by then. After Thursday’s debate came to a close, the legislation was sent to committees as talks to secure support continue on the sidelines.

With time tight, Merz’s Christian Democrat-led bloc and the Social Democrats — his potential governing coalition partner — are in negotiations with the Greens to secure their support, which is needed to pass the legislation. The party rejected the initial proposal as a way to finance election favors. It is demanding changes such as tighter restrictions for defense spending and at the same time a wider definition of what counts as defense.

The Greens and the would-be ruling alliance are still far from reaching agreement on the infrastructure fund, even if they have gotten closer on defense spending, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private.

During his speech, Merz may have complicated issues by asking the Greens: “What more do you want than what we have proposed to you?” — eliciting loud and long protests from the plenary.

Katharina Dröge, the co-leader of Greens caucus in parliament, followed up Merz’s speech by charging the CDU leader with duping voters over his plans for the sake of attaining power.

“If you now wonder why the talks between us and you are going the way they are, then we can tell you: Because we don’t trust in your word,” she said, but still left the door open. “We are ready to talk.”

Merz and other leaders in his prospective coalition have held several meetings this week with the Greens and are working intensely on a solution, a person familiar with the talks said.

The CDU has moved toward the Greens by broadening the defense package to include intelligence services and civil protection, according to an official close to the talks. On the infrastructure fund, the conservatives have rejected the Greens’ request to lift debt restrictions, instead offering to extend the time frame to 12 from 10 years and transfer funds from a separate climate fund, the person said.

Even if the legislation is approved next week just before the new parliament is seated, Merz’s plans will face legal challenges. Cases have been filed by AfD lawmakers and the Left at Germany’s top court. AfD co-leader Alice Weidel called on Merz to “do the country a great service” and abandon his efforts to become chancellor.

If the spending initiative fails, it would seriously complicate coalition discussions and raise questions over Merz’s ability to lead a recovery. Europe’s largest economy has contracted for two consecutive years and faces pressure to rearm to deter Russia as a trade war brews with the US.



Lars Klingbeil, co-leader for the Social Democrats and a likely senior cabinet member if the parties manage to reach a coalition agreement, cited the “incalculability” of the Trump administration for the urgency of the spending plan.

“The postwar order has been shaken,” he said. “The old order hasn’t yet faded and the new order hasn’t yet emerged.”"
2025-03-13T13:18:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/top-fda-lawyer-resigns-two-days-after-appointment-announced,"The US Food and Drug Administration’s top lawyer resigned on Thursday, two days after her appointment was announced, the agency posted on the social media site X.

Before serving as the FDA’s chief counsel, Hilary Perkins worked for the Department of Justice’s consumer protection division. She joined the DOJ in 2019 during President Donald Trump’s first administration, according to her LinkedIn profile.

Perkins’s appointment was recently criticized by Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who posted on X that Marty Makary, Trump’s nominee for FDA commissioner, was “attempting to sneak a Biden abortion lawyer into top leadership at FDA.” Perkins declined to comment.

Hawley expressed concern about Perkins’s role in defending Biden administration policies including on abortion and Covid-19 vaccinations, saying that she “argued FOR Biden’s draconian, discredited vaccine mandates.”

Jody Hunt, a former assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice’s civil division during Trump’s first term, said members of Congress should be thankful Perkins worked on the cases “regardless of her personal views.”

“This attorney was doing her job when she defended whatever case she defended,” he said. “Career attorneys at the Department of Justice have an obligation and responsibility to defend challenges to federal statute.”

Hunt said cases are assigned based on experience and lawyers’ workload. “Attorneys do not have an ability to take a pass on a case,” he said. “I myself defended cases I didn’t agree with.”

Perkins is an acquaintance of Hunt because her husband worked for him.

After Perkins resigned, Makary, a Johns Hopkins Medicine surgeon, won Hawley’s vote. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, where Hawley is a member, voted 14-9 on Thursday to advance Makary’s nomination for FDA commissioner to the full Senate for consideration. Hawley said during the vote he had questioned Makary’s judgement but his confidence had been restored when Makary withdrew his support of Perkins.

Perkins’s appointment was announced in a press release on Tuesday."
2025-03-13T13:20:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/european-drink-makers-fall-as-trump-returns-to-a-favorite-target,"President Donald Trump turned to a favorite target — European producers of alcoholic drinks — in the latest escalation of a global trade war.

Shares of Pernod Ricard SA, Remy Cointreau SA and LVMH, the maker of Dom Perignon Champagne and Hennessy Cognac, fell Thursday after Trump threatened to impose a 200% tariff on European wine and other alcoholic drinks.

Trump threatened to apply the tariffs in a social media post after the EU said it would impose duties on $28 billion of US goods, including American whiskey, beginning next month. The new levy would apply to all wine, Champagne and other alcohol from the EU, he said.

Pernod fell as much as 3.9% on Thursday in Paris. It’s down by more than a third over the past 12 months. Remy, which has lost about half of its value over that period, was down as much as 4.5%.

Trump had already targeted European wine and spirits during his first term in office, imposing a 25% tariff on a range of drinks and food products.

Separately, French Cognac producers are caught up in a trade dispute between the European Union and China. After the EU’s decision to move forward with duties on Chinese-made electric vehicles, Beijing responded by targeting EU brandy, including French Cognac. That followed an investigation into allegations that producers were dumping the spirit in the Chinese market.

Since then, French shipments to China have tumbled, and producers such as Pernod have lowered their financial guidance.

A trade group, spiritsEurope, had already signaled concern about escalating trade wars after the European Union announced tariffs on US whiskey and other alcoholic drinks, urging the EU to keep spirits out of unrelated disputes.

Pernod, Remy and Davide Campari-Milano NV, the Italian company behind the Aperol Spritz craze, are among the most exposed to Trump’s latest move, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Duncan Fox, with each potentially facing an earnings-per-share hit of 5% to 15%.

London-based Diageo Plc, which exports almost £1 billion ($1.3 billion) of Scotch whisky to the US, could benefit if the UK, which is outside the EU, steers clear of Trump’s tariff threats, Fox said in a note."
2025-03-13T13:28:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/novo-nordisk-skeptic-finally-upgrades-stock-after-drop-from-peak,"A long-term Novo Nordisk A/S skeptic recommended buying shares of the Danish weight-loss drug maker nine years after starting coverage of the stock.

Kepler Cheuvreux’s David Evans, who previously described hype around obesity drugs as a “bubble,” said his concerns around competition and pricing are now factored into Novo’s stock price. That’s after it fell by about 50% from last year’s record high.

“This is finally the entry point,” Evans wrote in a note to clients Thursday as he lifted his rating on the Wegovy and Ozempic maker to buy from hold. The shares rose as much as 5.5%.

Evans flagged potential gains of 24% in Novo stock from Wednesday’s close over the next 12 months as he assigned a 630 kroner price target. That remains one of the lowest among firms tracked by Bloomberg, with the average suggesting about 60% upside from 23 buy ratings, nine holds and two sells.


Novo shares have tumbled from their peak amid disappointing trials of the firm’s next-generation weight-loss shot, CagriSema, as well as broader worries about valuations in an increasingly competitive market.

Even so, the stock has almost tripled in value since Kepler started coverage in July 2016.

“After a few years of us thinking that market optimism on Novo was excessive, we now think the pendulum has swung too far the other way,” said Evans."
2025-03-13T13:31:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/venezuela-to-resume-receiving-deportation-flights-us-says,"The US on Friday will resume deportation flights to Venezuela that its government had halted after President Donald Trump’s decision to revoke Chevron Corp.’s license to operate in the country, an American official said.

“I am pleased to announce that Venezuela has agreed to resume flights to pick up their citizens who broke U.S. Immigration Laws and entered the U.S. illegally,” Trump’s special envoy, Ric Grenell, said in a post on X. “The flights will resume Friday.”

The announcement marks improving relations between the two countries after Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said on Saturday that the US “had damaged communications” by revoking the Chevron license.

Top Maduro negotiator, Jorge Rodríguez, confirmed a deal was reached with the US to restart the flights in a post shared on social media on Thursday.

Last year, Maduro suspended the flights after President Joe Biden threatened to reimpose oil sanctions in response to the Venezuelan leader’s failure to follow through on commitments for democratic reforms. The flights resumed in February after Grenell visited Caracas and secured the release of six American citizens from Venezuelan prisons, but they were halted earlier this month after the US Treasury gave Chevron 30 days to stop operating in the country.

Three flights arrived in Venezuela last month, carrying about 370 passengers either directly from the US or from Honduras after arriving from the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

The administration proposal to house as many as 30,000 detainees at Guantanamo has encountered legal and other challenges.

Maduro’s government said the Trump administration had told them that roughly 5,000 migrants could be subject to deportation."
2025-03-13T13:37:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/india-forex-reserves-record-biggest-weekly-gain-since-2021,"India’s dollar stockpile had its biggest weekly gain in over three years, bolstered by the Reserve Bank of India’s currency swap operations last month.

Foreign exchange reserves grew by $15.3 billion to nearly $654 billion in the week to March 7, data released on Thursday showed. That is the highest weekly gain since Aug. 27, 2021, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.

This comes after the central bank injected $10 billion through a foreign-exchange swap auction on Feb. 28, stepping up efforts to ease a cash crunch in the financial system. The swap entails the central bank purchasing dollars from banks against the rupees they hold, while contracting to sell the greenback at a future date.

“The swap essentially adds to reserves and would imply a similar amount of draw-down when the swap matures,” said Sakshi Gupta, principal economist at HDFC Bank. “The reserves are also supported by valuation gains due to increase in gold prices,” she said."
2025-03-13T13:43:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/trump-sued-by-states-over-dismantling-of-education-department,"President Donald Trump was sued by a group of mostly Democratic-led states over his alleged plan to effectively dismantle the US Education Department by slashing its workforce in half.

The plan to fire about 1,378 employees, on top of buyouts taken earlier by 600 workers, will undermine the Education Department’s ability to perform work mandated by federal law, states including New York and California said in a suit filed Thursday in federal court in Boston.

The suit against Trump and Education Secretary Linda McMahon adds to a growing list of cases challenging the administration’s effort to slash spending and reshape the federal government through Elon Musk’s controversial Department of Government Efficiency.

The massive reduction in force, or RIF, “is not supported by any actual reasoning or specific determinations about how to eliminate purported waste in the department — rather, the RIF is part and parcel of President Trump’s and Secretary McMahon’s opposition to the Department of Education’s entire existence,” the states say in the complaint.


Earlier suits are challenging alleged plans to shutter the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the US Agency for International Development, or USAID.

The Department of Education said in a statement that the reductions were “internal facing” and wouldn’t directly affect students and families. The White House said that the cuts were designed to deliver on Trump’s campaign promises.

“Partisan elected officials and judicial activists who seek to legally obstruct President Trump’s agenda are defying the will of 77 million Americans who overwhelmingly re-elected President Trump,” White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement. “Their efforts will fail.”

The Education Department said in a March 11 statement announcing the cuts that the agency “will continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency’s purview.”

But the states say that claim is “easily belied” by the extent of the workforce reduction, as well as McMahon’s assertion on the same day that terminations were the first step toward a “total shutdown.”

The states allege the administration is likely to fire more workers and wind down the entire department, citing public comments by McMahon and others.

“Far from being just a ‘first step,’ the layoffs are an effective dismantling of the department,” according to the states, which allege the reduction violates the US Constitution and the federal Administrative Procedure Act.

According to the complaint, the Education Department performs vital services that are mandated by federal law, including providing funds for low-income children and students with disabilities. The department also enforces laws that prohibit discrimination in education and administers federal student aid programs.

The Education Department was created through an act of Congress and can only be dismantled the same way, according to the suit. The president can’t unilaterally order the closure of the department, and even the Education Secretary is only permitted by law to “modestly restructure” the agency, the states say.


The department serves more than 50 million students at nearly 100,000 public schools and 32,000 private schools, and more than 12 million higher education students, according to the complaint. Before Trump’s election, the department carried out its tasks with a “lean staff of only 4,133 people,” the states said.

“Do not play politics with our kids’ education,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. “Donald Trump, his unelected billionaire wrecking ball Elon Musk, and their enabler Linda McMahon want to destroy the Department of Education, and they do not care what harm this inflicts on our kids and teachers.”"
2025-03-13T13:47:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/orient-overseas-warns-of-tougher-2025-after-closing-strong-year,"Orient Overseas International Ltd. warned of trade uncertainties ahead as geopolitical tensions with the US intensify, coming off a year in which the container shipper posted better-than-expected earnings.

“The reshaping of the global supply chain will undoubtedly affect the container shipping market in the long term,” the company said in an exchange filing. It said the US administration’s new policies will be “impacting the global economy and supply chain in the short and long run.”

Signs of the Red Sea situation stabilizing and the potential resumption of passage through the Suez Canal will release capacity and lead to freight rates normalizing, the company said.

Net income grew 88% to $2.58 billion in 2024 amid strong import demand and high freight rates, beating the $2.47 billion average analyst estimate. Revenue for the Cosco Shipping Holdings Co. subsidiary grew 28% to $10.7 billion.

Rising protectionism, uncertain consumer demand trends and softer freight rates may spell challenges for the container shipping sector, said Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Stephane Kovatchev and Kenneth Loh. Freight rates are down almost 60% from their July peak, largely driven by the US tariffs from key trade partners such as China and the European Union."
2025-03-13T13:51:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/us-whiskey-makers-look-to-flood-market-ahead-of-eu-tariffs,"American distillers have been rushing to prepare for the possibility of steep tariffs in the European Union as the looming deadline for a 50% tax on American whiskey becomes more of a reality.

To cope, some are ferrying as much product as possible to the EU — one of the industry’s biggest export markets — before the April 1 deadline.

Koval, a Chicago distillery founded in 2008, is ramping up shipments to reassure distributors, keep prices stable and secure shelf space against competitors, said co-founder Sonat Birnecker Hart.

“We’ve been working with our distributors abroad to provide them with a level of understanding that we do want to remain in the market. We’ve also sent more product over to try and weather the storm,” she said.

The whiskey tariff is part of the EU’s retaliatory response to ongoing US trade restrictions on steel and aluminum that started during President Trump’s first term in office. On Thursday morning, Trump threatened to impose a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne, and other alcoholic beverages unless the EU lifts its 50% tariff on US whiskey, he said in a social media post. “This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the US,” he added. Though Champagne, by definition, can only come from France’s Champagne region.

American whiskey was previously subject to a 25% tariff, which the EU imposed in 2018 but suspended in late 2021 as part of trade negotiations under President Biden. Since then, American whiskey has been tariff-free in the EU. However, the 50% tariff is set to take effect on April 1 unless the US and EU reach a last-minute agreement before the end of the month.


US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said he plans to speak with EU officials later Thursday, expressing hope that “they’ll realize they should take these things down.”

“The president was totally annoyed that the Europeans did this,” Lutnick told Bloomberg Television. “He cares about America and wants to take care of Americans. Why are the Europeans picking on Kentucky bourbon or Harley-Davidson motorcycles?”

One coping strategy distillers can’t use is relocating production elsewhere to avoid tariffs, said Chris Swonger, chief executive officer of Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, the industry’s top lobbying group. Certain spirits, including bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, Cognac and Irish whiskey, have protected designations, which means they can only be made in specific countries or regions.

The EU’s announcement is “deeply disappointing and will severely undercut the successful efforts to rebuild US spirits exports in EU countries,” Swonger said in a statement.

US distiller Brown-Forman Corp, the maker of Jack Daniel’s, is poised to be impacted substantially as the EU accounts for about 20% of net sales, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kenneth Shea. “If imposed, I believe it could materially impact the company’s sales growth and gross margin,” he said.

Brown-Forman said it was hopeful that both the US and the EU would reach an agreement before the tariffs snap into effect next month, Elizabeth Conway, a spokesperson for Brown-Forman, said.

“We are continuing to prepare for different scenarios and are committed to navigating these evolving circumstances to best serve our consumers and stakeholders — just as we have done for the last 155 years,” Conway said.

Many producers are only now recovering from the impact of tariffs that were put in place almost seven years ago. From 2018 through 2021, when the 25% tariff was first leveled by the EU in response to Trump’s duties on steel and aluminum, American whiskey exports to the EU plunged 20%, from $552 million to $440 million, said Marten Lodewijks, president of market research firm IWSR US. The trade war also caused a string of headaches for distillers, including canceled export contracts and halted investment and expansion plans.


Brown-Forman decided to absorb the cost when the tariffs were first imposed, expecting the duties wouldn’t remain in place for more than a few months. That move resulted in annual expenses of $80 million, squeezing profit margins and restraining the company’s hiring and growth plans.

“Brown-Forman’s gross margins were negatively impacted as it chose to essentially pay for the tariffs rather than raise prices in the EU on its affected products, and thereby lose sales and market share,” Bloomberg Intelligence’s Shea said. “It is possible that this could happen again.”

Smaller US distillers are feeling the pressure, too. Brough Brothers, the first African American-owned distillery in Kentucky, opted to withdraw from the EU market in 2020 after grappling with the tariffs. Now, with a potential 50% tariff on the table, the Louisville-based distillery has been looking at other international markets, including India and Brazil, as a backup plan. It’s also considering expanding its exports beyond whiskey – the company’s portfolio already includes rum, gin and vodka.

“A 50% tariff is really steep. If 25% was tough, 50% is almost a non-starter. It will seriously impact our ability to sell in the EU,” Brough Brothers CEO Victor Yarbrough, said.

“If there’s a silver lining, it may be that the UK, which is now outside the EU market, will not retaliate and will continue to work towards a trade deal,” Yarbrough added.

These tariffs could have long-term consequences, disrupting multi-year production plans and pushing price-conscious consumers to switch to other brands or products, said Melissa Gordon, the CEO of MGX Beverage Group, a supply chain and logistics company specializing in the alcoholic beverage industry. And the trickle-down effects could reach far beyond manufacturers.


“Today, distillers employ around 25,000 people in the US and positively impact the business of a much larger world of ingredient, packaging, sales and logistics companies. All are at risk of attrition,” she said.

For the moment though, distillers are busy flooding the European market with rushed shipments. “We are definitely experiencing demand being pulled forward,” Gordon said."
2025-03-13T14:00:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/blackstone-s-17-billion-property-lending-arm-isn-t-giving-up-on-its-office-bets,"After a yearslong downturn that left US offices empty, Blackstone Inc. President Jon Gray sees the sector as ripe for new bets. His real estate dealmakers are preparing to scoop up a stake in a 50-story building in Midtown Manhattan, the strongest signal yet that it sees the market primed for a rebound.

Executives running the firm’s commercial mortgage trust, meanwhile, are still sorting through old office loans gone bad. Blackstone Mortgage Trust Inc. untangled more than $1 billion of soured debt, mostly tied to offices, in the final quarter of last year.

And the REIT — known by its ticker, BXMT — still has more than $1 billion of troubled loans in its roughly $17 billion book. It’s a reminder that the real estate recovery is uneven and halting.

“We’ll certainly see less office in the portfolio as we move forward here,” BXMT Chief Executive Officer Katie Keenan, a 13-year Blackstone veteran, told analysts last month. The trust had just posted its first full-year net loss since Blackstone took it over in 2012. Much of the loss came from recognizing that BXMT couldn’t collect some loans in full.

BXMT shares finished last year down some 50% from their pandemic peak, lopping off about $2 billion in market value before rebounding in February. It’s just a small part of the wider firm that manages $1.1 trillion, but the lender’s health is intertwined with parts of Blackstone. A handful of borrowers — such as Australian gaming company Crown Resorts — are managed by the world’s largest commercial real estate owner.


Blackstone has emphasized that offices are less than 2% of its US real estate equity portfolio. BXMT, on the other hand, was filled with office loans — more than 50% of its portfolio — at the very start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Through write-offs, repayments and taking the keys to buildings, it has shrunk that share to about a third. More than half of BXMT’s US office loans are watchlisted or impaired.

“The office loan exposure was the big overhang on their stock for about two years,” Harsh Hemnani, a senior analyst at real estate research firm Green Street, said of BXMT. “Now we’re seeing that resolving itself, but also certain things will take time to play out.”

Short sellers such as Carson Block warned the REIT would get swept up in the commercial property meltdown. Block disclosed a bet against BXMT in late 2023, and the trust slashed its dividend less than a year later. Block didn’t respond to a request for comment on the status of his short position, though he told Bloomberg Television this week his firm is “happy” its thesis played out. Still, Block said he’s less sure about the short case for commercial real estate going forward given uncertainty around rates. Short positions in BXMT have halved to about 8.4% of outstanding shares over the past year or so, according to data compiled by S&P Global.

BXMT says its fortunes are lifting as a real estate recovery gathers momentum.

“One year ago, we said that real estate values were bottoming and that’s exactly what has happened,” BXMT said in an emailed statement. The trust is moving aggressively to deploy near-record liquidity into new loans, and office loans are throwing off cash, according to the statement. More than half of repayments in roughly the past year have come from office loans.

Still, investors have little appetite for all but the best offices. The trust is working to sell a collateralized loan obligation — essentially a bond made up of loans it has originated — for the first time since 2021. The deal will be backed mostly by apartment complexes, hospitality and industrial properties, a shift from prior CLOs linked mostly to office buildings.


Blackstone’s real estate team was bullish on office landlords in major metropolitan areas a decade ago, according to people familiar with the matter. CEO Steve Schwarzman told associates the buildings could still be profitable even if they were only half occupied, another person said.

But few predicted the upheaval that the Covid-19 pandemic would bring. Values have fallen by more than 75% on average from the peak for most buildings in New York, according to Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh, a professor at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Business.

And BXMT carried much greater global office exposure than peers. While the Blackstone unit had more than half its portfolio tied to office loans at the start of the pandemic, similar arms at Apollo Global Management Inc. and KKR & Co. reported concentrations below 30%.

Analysts have questioned whether the trust needs to reserve more for potential credit losses. BXMT set aside about $734 million to account for near-term credit losses at the end of 2024, according to company filings. That’s up from $125 million at the end of 2021.

Hemnani, the Green Street analyst, said the trust’s loan loss reserves still aren’t big enough.

“We still think their CECL reserves are not fully accounting for the losses that they might experience,” he said, referring to the accounting term for near-term loan losses. “But the gap between the losses we’re expecting and their reserves is narrowing very quickly.”

In a statement, the trust said it has taken a prudent approach to its reserves that has been “validated by the fact that our resolutions have overall been more favorable than implied by our loss reserves.”

It resolved $1.6 billion of impaired loans in 2024 above carrying values.

Queens Warehouse
BXMT has been working to clean up less-than-pristine deals as the office market slowly recovers. In New York, for example, Blackstone put additional capital into the Falchi Building, which has a $200 million loan with BXMT that wasn’t repaid upon maturity, according to people familiar with the matter. Located in an industrial part of Queens near a recycling plant and construction suppliers, the warehouse-turned-office leases space to Uber and New York City’s taxi commission.


BXMT also resorted to some financial engineering to buy borrowers time. In the past year, the trust has agreed to let certain borrowers delay cash payments in exchange for higher interest and more fees. Some of the modifications include payment in kind, which means interest payments are delayed and instead added on to the principal due. Such maneuvers are rarely a good sign for a borrower. Still, these represented a small fraction of BXMT’s interest income — only 1% by one measure — last year, the trust said.

The trust has received more financial wiggle room itself. Last year, to avoid violating a covenant on BXMT’s own borrowings, executives persuaded banks to loosen restrictions on the debt. It said the agreement is “generally standard” among its peers.

Blackstone’s broader real estate lending unit, helmed by 14-year firm veteran Tim Johnson, has been through some personnel changes. Mike Nash — who co-founded the real estate debt business and was known for composure during complex workouts — moved to the firm’s hedge fund arm in 2021 and recently retired, though he remains on BXMT’s board. Jonathan Pollack, Blackstone’s former head of real estate credit, left last year to become Starwood Capital Group’s president.

And BXMT executives aren’t swearing off offices for good. They just saw their marquee deal — a 2018-era, $1.8 billion loan for a Manhattan skyscraper called The Spiral — repaid in full.

“If we could do more deals like The Spiral, we absolutely would,” Keenan, the CEO, said during the earnings call. But in a quarter in which BXMT invested and pledged more than $2 billion in originations, she warned the firm will tread carefully. “The aperture of the type of office opportunities and where we see outperformance is quite narrow, and we’re going to be extremely selective.”"
2025-03-13T14:00:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/uk-households-face-600-blow-in-april-as-bills-go-up,"April is shaping up to be the cruelest month for British households.

Calculations by Bloomberg show Britons are facing a hit of almost £600 ($776) as water bills, energy costs and other regulated services go up in price.

The increases threaten to deliver a double blow to the struggling UK economy by driving up inflation and leaving consumers less disposable income to spend. That’s bad news for Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves as she prepares to announce what’s expected to be a sobering economic update on March 26 against a backdrop of global uncertainty.

For some, the price hikes will add to an already growing burden. Food costs are rising again, and in January the government slapped 20% value-added tax on private school fees — adding thousands of pounds to household bills. Many will see their mortgage payments rise when they come off cheap-fixed rate loans. Britons were more gloomy about the economy last month than when the UK was emerging from a downturn a year earlier, according to GfK.


For companies, the potential hit to demand comes as they brace for a £26 billion increase in payroll taxes along with another big increase in the minimum wage. They also face an increase in the Plastic Packaging Tax, which threatens to put further upward pressure on food bills."
2025-03-13T14:00:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-03-13/iphone-16e-review-high-price-makes-it-far-from-a-budget-phone,"With a starting price of $599, Apple Inc.’s iPhone 16e is hardly a budget phone.


This new handset replaces the $429 iPhone SE as the cheapest phone in Apple’s lineup. And while it brings many of the iPhone 16’s features and enhancements, including Apple Intelligence and a programmable Action button, it cuts back on camera capabilities, display quality and other areas. So it’s neither cheap nor a full-fat iPhone. Who is it for?

People like me, perhaps. I’ve lived outside the Apple bubble for years now, opting for Android-powered devices offering better cameras and specs for the money. But I have many US friends whose digital lives depend on iMessage, and I look on with envy at the ubiquity of Face ID and the company’s unrivaled selection of third-party apps. The “it just works” quality of the iPhone user experience (while slightly less solid than it once was) still carries appeal — so, while I might not spend flagship-phone money on an iPhone, a lite version at a palatable price could be appealing.

In addition to Android converts, there’s a wide swath of existing iPhone owners who’d welcome quality-of-life upgrades without spending four figures on a top-of-the-line device. In the US, where Apple is the leading mobile brand, consumer confidence in February fell the most in years on concerns about the outlook for the broader economy, signaling wariness of discretionary purchases. Elsewhere, in growing markets like India, price sensitivity could also see the 16e emerge as the favored option in Apple’s lineup — but it's impossible to ignore that the device is still hundreds of dollars more than the average seller in the country.

The Business Case
Apple’s smartphones have never been cheap. The first-generation iPhone was a status item when it debuted in 2007, with then Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer famously laughing it off as wildly expensive at $500. A decade later, the iPhone X normalized $1,000 handsets. Even now, with its lowest-end phone, Apple is asking more than double the average selling price from other manufacturers, per IDC data.

It’s the clearest sign that Apple has lost interest in competing in the value segment. In nearly a decade of trying to carve out a share with the iPhone SE, the company has underwhelmed consumers and fallen shy of its own high expectations. Competition has intensified, with Samsung Electronics Co. fending off aggressive Chinese rivals. Brands like Oppo’s OnePlus, Poco and Nothing Phone are bringing a mix of high specs, fresh designs and rock-bottom prices. Instead of continuing in a competitive segment of the market with low margins, Apple has decided to pull up the drawbridge and underline the idea that all of its products are premium.

The question, then, isn’t really whether the 16e is a high-quality phone — it is. But does it offer enough premium features to justify being pricier than true budget phones?

What Works
Though it shares a name with the higher-end iPhone 16 and 16 Pro, the 16e has a simplified, more utilitarian design, available in black or white. (Pro tip: The white option hides scratches much better.) Its dimensions are practically the same as the 6.1-inch iPhone 16, but with a single camera on the rear, making it feel a bit easier to handle.


After two weeks of living with it as my everyday phone, I’ve found the 16e to be good enough in most respects. The battery life is reliable, and the Apple-made A18 chip delivers consistently fast performance, even with a small spec downgrade (one fewer graphics processing core) that’s unimportant in practice. The 16e also marks the debut of Apple’s in-house wireless modem, replacing one from Qualcomm Inc. The new component doesn’t call much attention to itself, and that’s a good thing; I didn’t notice a step down in connectivity speed from my usual smartphone.

Loudspeakers are often an overlooked phone component, but in side-by-side testing, the 16e’s audio quality stood above much pricier flagship phones from Xiaomi Corp., Vivo and Google. In daily use, which included listening to a steady diet of podcasts and hip-hop, I often didn’t bother using a Bluetooth speaker since the 16e was adequate on its own.

Also on the audio front, anytime I turn on my paired wireless headphones, the lock screen surfaces my recently played Apple Music albums for quick access. This feature has been present in iOS for years, but it's a nice touch for someone new to the ecosystem.

The phone’s battery promises similar runtime as the iPhone 16 and, in my experience, can make it through a full day of work and leisure with plenty of juice left over. At a time when competitors like Alphabet Inc.’s Google Pixel phones have actually taken a step back in battery life, the 16e crunches through YouTube sessions, games, workout runs and Zoom calls without causing the smartphone equivalent of range anxiety.

More than anything, I can appreciate as a longtime Android user how much more cohesive the iPhone experience is. Apple’s Face ID is supported universally, leaving no guesswork about whether your local bank will let you log in with your face. On Android, Honor Device Co. uses similar biometric technology, but it’s a toss-up as to which developers choose to support it.

In the time I’ve been away, Apple’s Siri assistant has learned some new tricks. I can ask it to play Kendrick Lamar on Spotify and it starts playing GNX. With headphones connected, it’ll turn down my music and announce that I have a WhatsApp message and who it’s from, reading the content and also pronouncing people’s names correctly. Still, it doesn’t stand apart from other digital assistants. Worse, Apple has delayed some of Siri’s most ambitious AI upgrades for the foreseeable future.

What’s Missing
The pill-shaped Dynamic Island and Camera Control button for easier camera access did not make it into this watered-down iPhone. Opinions will vary on how important those omissions are, though I’m at peace with them. Given the very basic 48-megapixel rear camera, the absence of Apple’s premium video-recording modes also makes sense.

Anyone upgrading from a years-old or lower-tier handset will be satisfied with the camera’s quality. But the lack of a second shooter for zoomed-in shots, or a macro mode for closeups, will be a tough sell for consumers who see other phone makers serving up excellent zoom cameras. Particularly in China, where more is always more, the single-camera setup will be seen as a huge disadvantage.

My foremost camera concern is image quality, and that’s where Apple really cannot hang with cheaper Android alternatives. Google’s $499 Pixel 8a can already take better shots than the iPhone 16, and the less capable 16e is simply no match.

Another shortcoming is the 16e’s frugal amount of internal storage: 128GB at the starting price. The OnePlus 13R, which costs the same at $599, has double the storage as well as a multi-camera array on the back, faster charging and a wall adapter in the box. The Pixel 8a is cheaper and comes in a couple of lovely color options. (And the 9a is arriving shortly too.) In short, Android alternatives always offer better hardware for the money — the user experience just isn’t as polished.

Having said that, Android may actually be ahead on the AI front, as Apple Intelligence is a disappointing work-in-progress and Siri still awaits an overhaul. I’ve not yet come across any AI features that would compel me to purchase one device over another, but Apple has significant catching up to do, even compared to Google’s unimpressive Gemini chatbot."
2025-03-13T14:00:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/warren-calls-for-ethics-probe-into-tesla-white-house-event,"A group of Democratic senators led by Elizabeth Warren is calling for an ethics investigation into a White House event promoting Tesla Inc.

The demand comes after President Donald Trump on Tuesday held an impromptu press conference to support his billionaire adviser and Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk. During the event, five Teslas were displayed outside of the White House. Trump praised the cars as “beautiful” and selected a red Model S to purchase.

Musk, who is designated a special government employee and helps lead Trump’s government cost-cutting effort known as the Department of Government Efficiency, is bound by federal ethics laws preventing officials from using their public positions for private gain.

“By promoting Tesla during an official press conference with the President while using the White House as a backdrop, Mr. Musk appeared to leverage his senior role in the government and the authority associated with the presidency to recommend Tesla and to imply that the Trump Administration endorses Tesla vehicles,” Warren wrote in the letter, which was co-signed by Democratic Senators Adam Schiff, Cory Booker and Richard Blumenthal.


The senators called on the Office of Government Ethics to look into the potential violation. They also raised the possibility that Musk might have violated a separate statute preventing officials from using government property for commercial purposes.

Ultimately, enforcement of the ethics laws falls to the White House. During the first Trump administration, an investigation of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway’s promotion Ivanka Trump’s businesses resulted in a meeting to review the standards with no further punishments taken."
2025-03-13T14:02:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/faa-proposes-inspections-on-boeing-787-dreamliner-nose-component,"The US Federal Aviation Administration proposed a directive to require inspections of a key structural component at the nose of Boeing Co.’s 787 Dreamliner.

The proposed airworthiness directive published Thursday was “prompted by reports of multiple nonconformances, including excessive gaps and pull-up, found during the assembly and installation of the forward pressure bulkhead,” the FAA said. The order would require internal and external inspections of the component, which helps maintain cabin pressure.

Boeing last year said during a briefing at its 787 factory in North Charleston, South Carolina, that it would recommend operators conduct a visual inspection of the forward pressure bulkhead after finishing a multiyear review of the structural integrity of the US planemaker’s marquee widebody plane. At the time, the company said it was also discussing the issue with regulators.

The briefing, which occurred in April, was held to dispel a whistleblower’s claims that the company had taken shortcuts during the assembly of the 787. The company has said the issues with the forward pressure bulkhead are unrelated to the whistleblower’s claims, which it’s disputed.

The FAA noted that Boeing issued an alert to operators in October 2024.

The aviation regulator said that if not addressed, the conditions found on the nose component “could result in undetected fatigue cracks that can grow to weaken the primary structure where it cannot sustain limit load, which could adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane.”

Boeing didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
2025-03-13T14:04:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/senate-committee-votes-to-advance-trump-s-fda-nih-nominees,"The resignation of a top US Food and Drug Administration lawyer helped convince Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, a member of a key US Senate panel, to advance the nomination of FDA commissioner nominee Marty Makary, he said at a Thursday hearing.

Hawley’s vote helped Makary, a Johns Hopkins Medicine surgeon, sail through the committee with a 14-9 vote. The nomination of National Institutes of Health director pick Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University health economist and doctor, also moved ahead after a 12-11 vote.

Makary’s support of former FDA Chief Counsel Hilary Perkins “called into question to me Dr. Makary’s judgement,” said Hawley, who has criticized Perkins’s work during the Biden administration. He said that Makary had withdrawn his support of Perkins, “and that gives me some confidence. On that basis, I will vote yes.”

Hawley previously accused Makary of “attempting to sneak a Biden abortion lawyer into top leadership at FDA.” Before joining FDA, Perkins served in the Department of Justice’s consumer protection division, and Hawley expressed concerns about the lawyer defending Biden administration policies on abortion and Covid-19 vaccinations.


Perkins resigned on Thursday, according to an FDA post on the social media site X. She left the position just two days after her appointment to be the FDA’s top lawyer was announced. Perkins declined to comment about her resignation and Hawley’s remarks.

The votes by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions occurred later that morning. They signal that the nominees, who will next face votes before the full Senate, will likely be confirmed.

Earlier on Thursday, the same committee canceled a hearing for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nominee Dave Weldon after the White House withdrew him.

During confirmation hearings earlier this month, senators questioned Makary about a key public flu vaccine meeting that had been canceled. While Makary wouldn’t commit to rescheduling, he did say he’d have the FDA’s advisory panel on vaccines continue meeting.

The senators also pressed Bhattacharya about whether there would be continued cuts at the NIH, which he said he didn’t plan to do. Bhattacharya also declined to weigh in on his intentions for another cost-cutting measure, a proposed cap on NIH payments for researcher’s administrative expenses that can include cleaning supplies and security.

The directors of the FDA and NIH serve as the two top deputies for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was confirmed in mid-February. Kennedy has plans for a sweeping policy agenda called “Make America Healthy Again.”

Mehmet Oz, Trump’s pick to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, will face a hearing this week.

Trump’s picks have by and large been confirmed by the Senate."
2025-03-13T14:09:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/botswana-s-government-puts-diamond-trader-deal-on-back-burner,"Botswana’s deal to acquire a stake in Belgian gem trader HB Antwerp — proposed by the previous government but never completed — appears to be in limbo.

The plan for Botswana to purchase a 24% interest in HB Antwerp – first announced by former President Mokgweetsi Masisi in March 2023 – was seen as a model to challenge the southern African country’s decades-long partnership with De Beers. If executed, the deal would see state trader Okavango Diamond Co. receive polished rather than rough prices for stones for a portion of its sales.

Masisi’s administration, which was voted out of power in October, “was still doing due diligence and they never closed on that agreement,” Minerals and Energy Minister Bogolo Kenewendo said in an interview on Wednesday. “There was never anything signed on the dotted line, and so we have nothing really to progress.”

HB Antwerp still aims to conclude the transaction.

“The deal is definitely not abandoned and HB is committed to Botswana,” said Rafael Papsimedov, a co-founder of HB Antwerp.

The Belgian company was waiting for Botswana to finalize a new 10-year agreement with De Beers – which was signed late last month – and now intends to re-engage, he said. The firm has retained its workforce and invested in equipment despite the weak diamond market, according to Papsimedov.


Botswana set aside 890 million pula ($60 million) in the 2024-2025 budget to acquire the shares. Kenewendo’s predecessor later said that sum should buy the nation a 49.9% stake in HB Antwerp, given the deepening downturn in the diamond market.

The diamond industry is facing a crisis as demand in China, a key consumer, has slumped and lab-grown gems continue to win share in some segments. Anglo American Plc is planning to offload its De Beers unit – in which Botswana owns 15% of the shares – and has written down the value of the subsidiary by $4.5 billion in little over a year.

Botswana typically provides about two-thirds of De Beers’s annual production, while the sales of the gems account for more than a third of the country’s budget revenue and most of its foreign exchange earnings.

HB Antwerp is also active in Botswana through an agreement to buy large stones produced at Lucara Diamond Corp.’s Karowe mine.

If the Belgian firm makes contact again, “we will see if it makes sense,” said Kenewendo, who was appointed to her post by President Duma Boko in November.

2025-03-13T14:12:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/us-objections-mean-g-7-faces-prospect-of-no-joint-statement-again,"The Group of Seven faces the prospect of failing to agree to a joint statement again, even after the draft of the communique was significantly watered down, said people familiar with the matter.

G-7 foreign ministers are gathered in Charlevoix, Quebec, until Friday. The people, who were granted anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations, warned consensus may not be reached, leaving the group of nations unable to issue a joint statement. The same circumstances unfolded on the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month, when the US objected to strong language on Russia.

Though Canada is working hard to find common ground, the efforts look set to fail, some of the people said, with US views too divergent from the rest of the compact. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, seen as one of the more traditional members of Donald Trump’s cabinet, is under pressure to disrupt proceedings, two of them said.

The latest draft communique seen by Bloomberg News shows the ministers are considering welcoming the agreement between Ukraine and the US from Tuesday, calling on Russia to reciprocate “unconditionally.” They are also considering calling for “confidence-building measures,” such as the release of prisoners of war, civilian and military detainees, as well as the return of Ukrainian children. References to Russian aggression have disappeared.


Similarly, language around the Middle East has also been softened, calling for a “pathway that will lead to a two-state solution” in Israel and occupied Palestinian territories. The reference to a two-state solution may not be approved by the US, as it successfully resisted such language in a G-7 statement issued during the Munich Security Conference, a person familiar said.

Phrasing around the Indo-Pacific has meanwhile been strengthened, the draft shows, with ministers considering calling on China to “engage substantively in nuclear arms control” as well as name-checking tensions in the East and South China Seas. Ministers are also considering referencing human rights abuses suffered by the Uyghurs in China.

“In these stormy times, we of course also need to talk about differences and make clear how we support peace coming from different perspectives. In which form we will conclude this process we will see in the end,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement.

One possible outcome is a so-called chair’s statement, some of the people said, in order to keep the G-7 alive. Such statements are issued by the summit chair and provide an overview of decisions made during the meetings but express views that may not have been agreed to by all participants.

Canada is also currently embroiled in a tariff war with the US. This G-7 meeting — held in the same rural Quebec town as the ill-fated 2018 summit that ultimately saw Trump rip up the communique — is largely about Canada trying to assess how to work with the new US administration. The northern nation is trying preserve some minimal common ground ahead of the leaders’ summit in June, the people said.

The US has made significant changes to its foreign policy stances since the Trump administration took power, with effects reverberating across traditionally allied capitals. It has already vetoed a Canadian proposal to create a G-7 task force aimed at monitoring shadow fleets, a key source of revenue for Russia, Bloomberg reported last week.

The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rubio and Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly embraced and shook hands ahead of a bilateral meeting on Thursday morning, and stood next to each other during the “family photo” of ministers.

In brief comments at the start of the first session, Joly told her counterparts that that maritime security was on the agenda, including “the use of growing shadow fleets,” as well as issues in the Red Sea, South and East China Seas and the Taiwan Strait. “So, looking forward to making sure that this is a success, working with all my friends and colleagues around this table,” she said.

Still, in a sign of Canada’s polite pushback against the US, the pens on the meeting tables were made with Quebec aluminum — a message against the Trump administration’s 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel.

2025-03-13T14:15:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/standard-bank-sees-south-african-coalition-surviving-budget-saga,"South Africa’s ruling coalition is unlikely to splinter despite differences between the partners over its first budget, Standard Bank Group Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Sim Tshabalala said.

Although the members of the so-called government of national unity are divided over budget policy, the coalition will likely ride out the storm intact.

“The base case is that the GNU in South Africa remains and continues to operate,” Tshabalala said in an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Jennifer Zabasajja. “The evidence in South Africa is that the coalition will subsist.”

Last year’s national election failed to produce an outright winner, forcing the African National Congress — which had held a parliamentary majority for three decades after apartheid ended in 1994 — to seek partners to get it past the 50% threshold needed to form a government.


Lawmakers called off last month’s presentation of the budget after the partners refused to back Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana of the ANC over plans to increase value-added tax by two percentage points this year.

A new proposal presented on March 12 trimmed the increase to 1 percentage point spread over two years. Still, the second-biggest party in the coalition, the Democratic Alliance, maintains it won’t support any permanent tax hikes or back the budget in its current form, but remains open to further negotiations.

Standard Bank’s Tshabalala said that such disagreements are normal within governments. He cited Germany — where a failure to agree on a budget resulted in the collapse of the coalition government — and the US, where Republicans and Democrats are wrangling over a spending bill to avert a government shutdown on Saturday.

“It’s normal in a country that is democratic for these conflicts to happen,” Tshabalala said, adding that the parties will likely seek a consensus on the budget.

He said the VAT proposal was “creative and careful” because it sought to ensure the government was able to generate much-needed revenue, without subjecting businesses and workers to higher income taxes.

The government’s commitment to reducing its debt to 76.2% of gross domestic product over the next year surpassed estimates from ratings companies, showing authorities’ focus on revenue and cost management, he said.

“The big question of course is ‘will the budget pass? Will it be supported by the GNU,’” Tshabalala said. “I don’t know. We will see.”

The Office for National Statistics said Thursday that it has pushed back the January trade release to March 28 after problems relating to services trade data for 2023. Earlier this week it flagged problems with the trade figures relating to tax data that affected non-EU goods imports, particularly from China and Japan.

“This delay gives us more time to process and revise the estimates to account for these identified errors,” the ONS said in a statement.

The trade data was scheduled to be released alongside GDP growth figures on Friday.

The ONS previously revealed issues in December’s trade data, saying that it could mean future revisions are made to GDP estimates. However, it expected a “minimal impact on quarterly GDP growth rates.”

It is the latest problem to beset official UK statistics after the accuracy of estimates for unemployment, employment and economic inactivity was thrown into doubt by a plunge in survey response rates. The ONS has faced criticism, including from Bank of England rate-setters, for the problems and delays in switching to a new labor market survey.

2025-03-13T14:25:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/italy-s-ibl-banca-eyes-srt-deal-arranged-by-unicredit-intesa,"Italy’s IBL Banca SpA is assessing investors’ interest for a significant risk transfer linked to a portfolio of salary-backed loans, according to people familiar to the matter.

The Rome-based lender is considering the SRT linked to a pool of around €1.8 billion ($2 billion) of loans, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. UniCredit SpA and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA are arranging the potential transaction, said the people. The size of the SRT would be about 6% of the reference portfolio, the people said.

The process is at a preliminary stage and terms, including the size of the transaction, are subject to changes as a result of discussions with investors, the people said. Representatives for IBL, UniCredit and Intesa declined to comment.

SRTs allow banks to insure loans against default by selling credit-linked notes to pension, sovereign wealth and hedge funds. For lenders, the benefit is that they are able to tie up less of their own capital to meet regulatory requirements. In return, investors receive yields that frequently top 10%.

Typically banks sell a credit-linked note to cover the first 5% to 15% of losses, and if losses materialize, holders of the SRTs absorb the hit. Banks use the transactions to offload risk and improve solvency ratios.

Italian banks have been active in SRTs against a backdrop of multiple potential deals that may reshape Italy’s banking sector this year. UniCredit is working on a significant risk transfer linked to a portfolio of almost €4 billion of German corporate loans, Bloomberg reported last month.

Elsewhere, Banco BPM SpA has been discussing with investors two SRT deals linked to portfolios worth about €4.5 billion, people familiar with the matter said in January, while rival BPER Banca SpA is considering selling its first SRT transaction.

The global amount of loans linked to SRTs to be issued this year could rise to close to €300 billion from €260 billion last year as banks continue to pile into the deals, according to estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence. Chorus Capital Management, which invests in SRTs, projects global issuance of such deals to grow to as much as $35 billion this year, which would be a new record.

Separately, IBL Banca is also using a pool of salary-backed loans — known as cessione del quinto- as collateral for an asset-backed securities deal out of its Marzio Finance program, Moody’s Ratings said in March 5 statement"
2025-03-13T14:26:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/doge-has-10-staffers-at-social-security-in-hunt-for-dead-people,"Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency now has 10 staffers at the Social Security Administration as the Trump White House looks for evidence to support its claim that there could be millions of dead people receiving public benefits.

Two sworn statements filed in federal court late Wednesday show that the SSA has staffed up in recent weeks to include four special government employees and six more DOGE staffers on loan from other departments.

Their mission: detecting waste, fraud and abuse in the nation’s 90-year-old social insurance agency.

Musk has called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme,” and suggested this week that there could be as much as $700 billion a year in entitlement fraud. Critics have said he is setting up a move to cut the popular program. Others are concerned about Musk’s team having access to Americans’ most sensitive data.

From 2015 through 2022, Social Security estimated that it made almost $72 billion in improper payments — less than 1% of benefits paid, according to an inspector general report last year. Not all of that amount was because of fraud, however, and all but $23 billion was able to be recovered.


At least seven DOGE staffers have been granted access to a database known as the Master File of Social Security Number Holders and SSN Applications, also known as Numident. They currently have read-only access as they try to connect the dots between Social Security numbers and possible fraudulent benefits.

That database is often missing dates of death, a fact that President Donald Trump and Musk, his billionaire adviser, have used as the basis of claims that more than 20 million people over 100 are still on the Social Security rolls.

“And money is being paid to many of them, and we’re searching right now,” Trump said in a speech to Congress last week.

Leland Dudek, an anti-fraud expert who Trump promoted to acting Social Security Commissioner last month after Dudek was suspended for cooperating with DOGE, has pushed back on those claims.

Just because a date of death is missing from Numident doesn’t mean payments are being made, Dudek said in a statement. Those are managed in a separate database, the Master Beneficiary Record.

“We are steadfast in our commitment to root out fraud, waste, and abuse in our programs, and actively correcting the inconsistencies with missing dates of death,” he said.

Death Data
Indeed, at least six DOGE staffers at the agency are working with death data. The Social Security Administration maintains a Master Death File of more than 94 million reported deaths collected from state records and funeral directors.

Other databases being used in the hunt are the Supplemental Security Record, which contains data on disability benefits and Treasury Department payment files. The benefits databases can also contain limited taxpayer information used to calculate eligibility for benefits.


DOGE has access to copies of the databases, limiting the ability to make changes, the agency’s chief technology officer, Michael Russo, said in a sworn statement. There are safeguards to ensure there are no private servers connected to SSA data, he said.

Russo’s statement was included in a court filing late Wednesday in a lawsuit brought by the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees. The public employees union filed suit against DOGE and the Maryland-based Social Security Administration, trying to block what it calls an “unprecedented data grab.”

The Social Security Administration has emerged as a key outpost for DOGE, because it administers $1.6 trillion in annual benefits but also because of its unique position to access a wide range of government data. Indeed, DOGE’s hunt for fraud in Social Security is also radiating out into other federal agencies.

Two DOGE team members also have access to the National Directory of New Hires, a database kept by the Heath and Human Services Departments’ Office of Child Support Services to help states enforce child support orders.

And one Social Security DOGE team member will soon be dispatched to the Small Business Administration.

The court filing also shows how DOGE team members can move around from agency to agency. Six Social Security DOGE staffers are on loan from other agencies, including the National Aeronautical and Space Administration, Office of Personnel Management, Labor Department and General Services Administration.


And one comes from the US DOGE Service, the White House agency created by Trump’s Inauguration Day executive order creating the cost-cutting initiative.

“The overall goal of the work performed by SSA’s DOGE Team is to detect fraud, waste and abuse in SSA programs,” Russo said. “This level of access ensures these employees can review records needed to detect fraud but does not allow them the ability to make any changes to beneficiary data or payment files.”

Neither Russo nor Deputy Commissioner Florence Felix-Lawson, who filed a separate sworn statement, would identify the DOGE staffers by name, “to avoid exposing them to threats and harassment.”

But special government employees and DOGE detailees at the agency include former Tesla board member Antonio Gracias of Valor Equity Partners; Scott Coulter, formerly of Lone Pine Capital; and Marko Elez, re-hired by DOGE and sent to Social Security after resigning from the Treasury Department over reports of racist social media posts.

2025-03-13T14:27:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/us-stocks-hover-near-correction-territory-as-tariff-risks-mount,"Tariff worries rattled Wall Street again Thursday, pushing the S&P 500 into a correction that left it at the lowest in six months.

The S&P 500 fell 1.4% on the day, bringing its three-week rout past 10%, a level that meets the technical threshold for a correction. It’s down more than 6% for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, also in a correction, tumbled 1.9% on the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3%, bringing it 9.3% below its last record in December.

The 16 trading sessions it took for the S&P 500 to tumble by this magnitude from its Feb. 19 high marks the seventh-fastest correction in records going back to 1929, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Three of the seven-fastest drawdowns of this magnitude happened under President Donald Trump - in 2018, 2020 and now.

“Most corrections take about two months to play out,” said John Kolovos, chief technical strategist at Macro Risk Advisors. While stocks appear oversold, “we aren’t there yet in terms of time, as it took us about two weeks to get to these levels,” he said.


Among the steepest single-stock declines, Tesla Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. helped pull the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks down. Adobe Inc. was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500, falling about 14% on a disappointing outlook.

Investor sentiment is souring even as recent data provided some evidence that the economy remains resilient. The gloom is a sign of just how much Trump’s policies, particularly around trade, have rattled Wall Street nerves. At the same time, waves of firings at federal agencies and deportation threats have eroded confidence in the labor market’s strength.

US stocks have been struggling to regain footing after snapping a two-year uptrend earlier this week. Chart watchers say the S&P 500 needs to recapture its 200-day moving average, which is currently near 5,738. Some technical charts also show the S&P 500 is already at oversold levels. The index’s 14-day relative strength index is hovering around 30, a level that is often considered a technical signal that a selloff has gone too far.

One contrarian signal may give bulls hope. The closely watched bull-bear ratio from the American Association of Individual Investors survey fell to 0.3 in the week through Wednesday, the lowest level since September 2022. The last time the indicator was this low before then was in 2009, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Those prior instances have coincided with stretches of bear-market bottoms in US stocks.

The S&P 500 has wiped out about $5 trillion in market capitalization since that peak in February on concerns that the president’s trade policies would stall economic growth. The Nasdaq 100 has plunged more than 10% from a high last month as investors questioned lofty valuations of the biggest tech stocks.

Sentiment took a further hit Thursday after Trump threatened to impose a 200% tariff on wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from France and elsewhere in the European Union, the latest escalation in a brewing trade war.

“Another day of tariff uncertainty is weighing upon markets once again,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, wrote in a note.

Several Wall Street strategists including at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. turned more cautious on US stocks this week. However, JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists said equities were pricing in a recession risk much bigger than credit markets, leaving room for a positive surprise."
2025-03-13T14:30:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/bofa-probe-needed-over-leon-black-money-to-epstein-wyden-says,"Senator Ron Wyden urged the US Justice and Treasury departments to investigate Bank of America over its role in facilitating $170 million in payments that private equity titan Leon Black made to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

In a letter made public Wednesday, the Oregon Democrat said the US should probe a “major financial institution” for potential violations of anti-money laundering laws in its handling of transactions involving Epstein. That institution is Bank of America, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The bank transferred $170 million from Black between 2013 and 2017 but did not make required filings to the Treasury Department about potentially suspicious payments until 2020, Wyden wrote.

“The bank failed to conduct meaningful due diligence on the payments to Epstein and cleared them without asking for information as to the nature of the transactions,” wrote Wyden, the ranking minority member on the Senate Finance Committee.

Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to Florida charges, including procurement of minors to engage in prostitution. Epstein died in a Manhattan jail in 2019 as he was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges involving underage girls. Both a medical examiner and an investigation by the FBI determined that Epstein died by suicide.

“The DOJ and Treasury have a moral obligation to follow the money and to demonstrate to the public that they will not cover up any information related to individuals or entities involved in these illegal acts,” Wyden wrote. “This must include a proper review into whether major US financial institutions turned a blind eye to the movement” of cash “likely used to pay for Epstein’s operations.”

Black, 73, retired as Apollo Global Management Inc.’s longtime chief executive officer in 2021 amid controversies, including public revelations over Epstein and their business ties. Black, the co-founder of Apollo, said he paid from 2012 to 2017 for Epstein’s advice on trust and estate planning, tax issues and the operation of his family office.

A spokesperson for Bank of America and a spokesperson for Black declined to comment. Spokespersons for the Justice and Treasury departments didn’t respond to a requests for comment.

Black agreed in January 2023 to pay $62.5 million to the US Virgin Islands to avoid a public legal battle over Epstein. That settlement agreement, made public by Wyden, said Epstein “used the money Black paid to him to partially fund his operations in the Virgin Islands.”

The New York Times initially reported that Wyden’s committee was examining how Bank of America didn’t file suspicious activity reports about the Epstein payments until years after they were made. Bloomberg News reported in 2023 that the Senate Finance Committee was investigating whether the money Black paid to Epstein amounted to gifts for which Black owed taxes.

A 2021 report by the law firm Dechert LLP found no evidence that Black knew of Epstein’s criminal activities. The law firm examined the relationship between the two men, which stretched from the mid-1990s to 2018. But the Wyden letter released Wednesday said that the Dechert report only examined $158 million in payments, not the true amount of $170 million.


However, the Dechert report discussed not only those $158 million in payments, but also $30.5 million in two loans that Black made to Epstein for an art transaction. Epstein repaid only $10 million before his death.

Black, the former chairman of the Museum of Modern Art, has a private art collection that is worth more than $1 billion. Black built a world-class art collection, including Edvard Munch’s “The Scream.”"
2025-03-13T14:30:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/us-hits-iran-s-oil-minister-and-shadow-fleet-with-new-sanctions,"The Trump administration is imposing sanctions on Iran’s oil minister, as well as targeting more companies and vessels linked to the “shadow fleet” that Tehran uses to circumvent sanctions.

The US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control on Thursday added to its list of “Specially Designated Nationals” Mohsen Paknejad, who as minister of petroleum “oversees the export of tens of billions of dollars’ worth of Iranian oil and has allocated billions of dollars’ worth of oil to Iran’s armed forces for export,” according to a Treasury statement.

The action is based on a January 2020 executive order in which President Donald Trump imposed sweeping sanctions on Iran’s petroleum and petrochemical sectors, and marks the third round of sanctions since the president’s Feb. 4 national security memorandum imposing a “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran.

The Treasury Department identifies vessels flagged in several countries as members of Iran’s shadow fleet, and designates their owners “for operating in the petroleum sector of the Iranian economy.”

The newly sanctioned ships include 10 oil and fuel tankers and three tugboats.


In a corresponding action, the State Department designated three companies “for having knowingly engaged in a significant transaction for the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport or marketing of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran.”

Earlier, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said his country will enter direct US talks if Washington ends “pressure and threats” against the Islamic Republic, the latest in a series of exchanges with Trump on the prospects of a fresh nuclear deal.

Although Trump has reinstated the “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran from his previous term, he also has said he wrote a letter to Iran’s leaders, urging them to enter talks on a new agreement limiting its nuclear program. The US president walked away from an international deal during his first term in 2018, and little progress has been made since then to revive the accord."
2025-03-13T14:37:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/deutsche-bank-sees-more-headwinds-from-commercial-real-estate,"Deutsche Bank AG expects headwinds to continue in commercial real estate markets, with weaknesses especially pronounced in the US where leasing activity is slower and vacancy rates are higher than in Europe.

The lender had set aside €664 million at the end of last year for expected credit losses from commercial real estate, a 44% increase from 2023, as the office market continues to struggle, it said in its annual report published Thursday.

US offices are among the worst-hit parts of the CRE market, as workers stayed home in the wake of the pandemic and higher interest rates made it difficult for borrowers to refinance. According to one study published last year, the value of Manhattan offices has declined by more than 75% from the peak for all but the best offices.

Deutsche Bank has been proactively working with landlords whose loans are nearing maturity, offering amendments and extensions. That contributed to a 19% increase in non-recourse loans classified as having significantly higher credit risk in the portfolio.


“A continuation of the current stressed market conditions could have a further adverse impact on commercial real estate property values and loan-to-value ratios,” according to the lender, which has about €50 billion of commercial real estate lending on its books."

EQT has been discussing possible scenarios with Houlihan Lokey Inc., including a liability management exercise, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the matter is private.

Houlihan Lokey hasn’t been formally appointed by EQT or Cerba and conversations may not lead to any concrete action, the people said.

With over €3 billion of term loans and revolving-credit facilities, as well as more than €1 billion of bonds, Cerba is one of the largest borrowers in Europe’s leveraged finance market.

The company’s second lien notes were indicated at 40.5 cents on the euro early on Thursday, about 27 cents lower since the beginning of the week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. First lien notes fell as much as 8 cents to 79.7 cents this week, the data show. Both sets of bonds have since recovered some of the losses.

On Wednesday, credit news platform Octus reported Cerba is working with Houlihan Lokey as an adviser.


A representative for EQT declined to comment. Spokespeople for Houlihan Lokey and Cerba didn’t return messages seeking comment.

Credit Downgrade
Cerba was taken over by the Swedish private equity firm from Partners Group and Canada’s Public Sector Pension Investment Board in 2021 as demand for hospital and laboratory assets increased amid the Covid-19 crisis.

While Cerba doesn’t face imminent maturities or covenant issues, Moody’s Ratings downgraded its credit score to Caa1 last September, toward the lower end of the spectrum of junk-rated debt. The agency noted that its gross debt would be ten times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization at the end of 2024.

The firm has been hit by new French regulations and by the high fixed costs associated with the business. However, it still has a leading market position in France and could ride on the positive demand trends for laboratory tests, according Moody’s report.

Cerba has about €3 billion ($3.3 billion) of term loans and revolving-credit facilities, making it one of the largest issuers of euro-denominated term loans. It’s also the top triple C-rated credit held by European collateralized loan obligations, the biggest buyers of leveraged loans.

In addition to its loans, Cerba has €720 million of secured bonds due in 2028 and €525 million of unsecured bonds due 2029."
2025-03-13T14:42:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/trump-spends-200-million-on-self-deportation-campaign-as-immigration-raids-lag,"The message is blunt, flashing on TV screens, streaming platforms and social media feeds across the country: Leave now, or we will find you.

Faced with the logistical and financial limits of mass deportations, the Trump administration has turned to a $200 million media campaign aimed at persuading undocumented immigrants to leave the US voluntarily.

Branded “Stay Out and Leave Now,” the effort combines the ad blitz with a self-reporting departure app launched this week, and warnings from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that those who don’t leave will be caught and permanently barred from returning.

“Leave now. If you don’t, we will find you and we will deport you. You will never return,” Noem warns in a domestic ad. In an international version, she tells would-be migrants not to “even think about it. Let me be clear, if you come to our country and break our laws, we will hunt you down.”


The Trump administration’s promised mass arrest and deportation effort got off to a swift and costly start after his inauguration in January, with high-profile raids across the country and multiple deportation flights — some on military aircraft — to Central and South America and India. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has recorded roughly 33,000 arrests since then. But the pace has slowed, leading to multiple leadership shakeups at the agency. Trump is now urging Congress to approve more funding to carry out the crackdown.


The push comes as unauthorized crossings at the southern border continue to decline, with thousands more troops deployed as part of a military buildup. In February, Border Patrol agents recorded just 8,300 illegal crossings, the lowest monthly total in decades. That trend began last summer when then-President Joe Biden imposed tighter restrictions on asylum eligibility, and Mexico ramped up efforts to interdict migrants.

Trump celebrated the decline in border encounters in a Thursday post entitled “Making America Safe Again” on Truth Social.

So far, DHS has spent nearly $2.4 million running the ads in various US markets, including metro areas such as New York, Dallas-Fort Worth, Phoenix, Arizona and Los Angeles, as well as more rural places like the Texas border region, according to data from ad-tracking firm AdImpact. The spots, running in multiple languages, feature dramatic montages of immigration arrests, mugshots of migrants accused of crimes, and footage of President Donald Trump standing at the border.

This week, the Trump administration also announced the launch of the CBP Home app, an overhaul of the CBP One app, which had been used by the Biden administration to allow hundreds of thousands of migrants to make appointments to request entry at a legal border crossing. Trump shut down CBP One app hours after being sworn in, canceling all pending appointments and closing a key pathway for asylum seekers.

“The CPB Home strengthens our mission to secure the border and provides illegal aliens with a straightforward way to leave now before facing much harsher consequences later,” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said at a briefing on Wednesday.

The administration already announced mandatory registration for most foreigners aged 14 and older who are in the county for more than 30 days. Visa holders and legal residents are largely exempt, but undocumented immigrants — and even some Canadians — are subject to the rule.


“The idea of self-deportation has been around for a very long time,” said Ben Johnson, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “But the problem with that strategy has always been that in order to drive people back to really horrible places things have to be really horrible here.”

Unlike formal deportations, self-removals are difficult to track. While ICE documents those transported on deportation flights, no reliable system exists for counting those who leave through land borders of their own accord. Johnson said immigrants should be wary of the registration effort and the CBP Home app.

“With the registration initiative, of course you would get apprehended, even if you said my intention is to self-deport,” Johnson said. “They are going to want you to be in their deportation numbers.”

DHS said in a statement that telling the government about plans to leave will be “safer, but it also saves US taxpayer dollars and valuable Customs and Border Protection and ICE resources.”

“The CBP Home app gives aliens the option to leave now and self-deport, so they may still have the opportunity to return legally in the future and live the American dream,” Noem said in a statement this week. “If they don’t, we will find them, we will deport them, and they will never return.”"

The economy has declined for five consecutive years and the gross domestic product per capita is seen dwindling to around half of the level in 2020, the lender said in a report.

South Sudan’s been hobbled by instability since its independence from neighboring Sudan in 2011 and has struggled to implement the terms of a 2018 peace accord to end a civil war that erupted shortly after its secession.

“The projected contraction is primarily due to the disruption of oil production, which has led to a significant decline in export revenues estimated at $7 million per day,” it said.

This has strained public finances, multiplying salary arrears and reducing spending on critical services like health and education, the World Bank said. In addition, the ensuing hyperinflation has worsened chronic food shortages and increased poverty to about 92%, according to the report."

Ltd. has ordered two offices in the European Parliament belonging to assistants to be sealed off.

Earlier Thursday hundreds of police carried out 21 searches across Belgium and Portugal, arresting several people over allegations they were involved in “active corruption within the European Parliament, as well as for forgery and use of forgeries. The offenses were allegedly committed by a criminal organization.”

The alleged corruption took place from 2021 to the present day and involved lobbying that included taking money in exchange for taking political positions as well as excessive gifts covering food, travel and sports, the prosecutor’s office said.

The bribery is said to be to the “benefit” of Huawei, it said. An individual has been arrested in France and a European arrest warrant issued.

“Huawei takes these allegations seriously and will urgently communicate with the investigation to further understand the situation,” a spokesperson said. “Huawei has a zero tolerance policy towards corruption or other wrongdoing.”


Belgian media and investigative journalism outfit Follow the Money reported the Huawei probe earlier. Spokespeople for Huawei didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

“We have received a request for cooperation from the Belgian authorities to assist the investigation, which the Parliament will swiftly and fully honor,” a European Parliament spokesperson said"

The Southern African Development Community terminated the mandate of its mission in Congo, known as SAMIDRC, and ordered a phased withdrawal, the 16-member grouping said in a statement Thursday.

The SADC’s under-resourced troops had failed to hold back the advancing M23 rebels, who in January and February seized two key cities near the border with Rwanda, including the main airports. That left the SAMIDRC bases largely stranded, cut off from supply lines and vulnerable, while having to repatriate their deceased troops through Rwanda.

Delegations from Congo and the M23 will begin direct peace negotiations on March 18 in Luanda, the capital of Angola, whose President João Lourenço is mediating the talks. That would mark the first meeting between the Congolese government and the rebel movement that President Felix Tshisekedi has referred to as terrorists and refused to engage with.

Congo, the US and the United Nations all accuse Rwanda of backing the M23, an allegation it’s repeatedly denied. Rwandan President Paul Kagame says his government is mainly interested in securing the border with Congo.

Some European states have halted or indicated intentions to scale back on aid cooperation with Rwanda because of its alleged involvement in the war."

“The US dollar priced in a lot after President Trump’s victory and the Republican sweep” of Congress, Bessent said in an interview with CNBC Thursday. “It’s natural to see an adjustment.”

While the US currency climbed in the wake of the Nov. 5 election on expectations of faster growth thanks to a platform of deregulation and extended tax cuts, it has dropped against most major currencies since Trump took office in January. Investors have cited growth concerns stemming from an escalating series of tariff hikes, along with prospects for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, as undermining dollar demand.



“The markets adopted a wait-and-see attitude” toward the growth-spurring Trump policies, Bessent said. “It’s natural that after this big surge in the dollar, that other currencies could do well.”


He said he told Business Roundtable representatives Wednesday that the administration is working on a tax-cut package along with deregulation, aiming to “create economic certainty.” He also said that a US government shutdown would be “incredibly disruptive” and that the Trump administration is aiming to extend the tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term in 2017 by “this summer.”

He dismissed the idea that his recent warning the economy would need to go through a “de-tox” period amounted to cautioning that a recession is looming. The administration wants a “smooth transition” from an economy based on increased levels of government spending to one that relies more on private sector activity, he said."

Harvard University terminated a librarian this month who ripped down a poster of Israeli hostages at a pro-Palestine rally, while Yale University’s law school placed a pro-Palestinian research scholar on leave over allegations that she has ties to a group subject to US sanctions.

At Cornell University, a group called Students for Justice in Palestine faces suspension after disrupting a “Pathways for Peace” event on campus this week, and the University of California at Los Angeles —- rocked last year by anti-Zionist rallies and accusations of mistreatment of Jewish students — created a new initiative to combat antisemitism. Columbia University, the scene of some of the most dramatic protests against Israel last year, said the school will transform its approach to managing demonstrations.

The actions come more than a year after donors to universities, including billionaires Ken Griffin, Len Blavatnik and Leon Cooperman, vowed to pause their giving after slamming schools over their approach to a range of issues from tackling antisemitism to free speech and diversity, equity and inclusion policies.


Their actions had limited impact on university policy. Demonstrations against Israel swept through US campuses last spring with tent encampments and acts of vandalism. Even as a Congressional investigation highlighted acts of antisemitism and breaches of university codes, few students or faculty were expelled or fired.

Now universities are taking a harder line as the White House ramps up financial pressure against schools that fail to meet Trump’s demands — actions that risk alienating staff and students without necessarily going far enough to appease the White House, Congressional Republicans and powerful alumni.

“Federal action carries far greater weight than alumni pressure, both in immediate financial impact and in regulatory consequences,” said Roni Braun, a Harvard alum and spokesperson for the Harvard Jewish Alumni Alliance. “The scale simply isn’t comparable,” Braun said, adding that the changes are still underwhelming.

A Harvard spokesperson said the school has taken many steps to discipline those who’ve violated policies long before the current administration took office and even before the November election. Those include law students and faculty banned from the library for silent protests last fall.

While campaigning for President, Trump flagged that he wanted to punish elite colleges following the protests that roiled campuses after the attack by Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and the Jewish state’s ensuing retaliation in Gaza. Several university presidents were hauled before a Congressional committee, and the leaders of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia quit.

Since taking office, the White House has ordered $400 million of funding cuts to Columbia University and has put other schools on notice they could be next. The administration has targeted billions of dollars of research money that flows through programs including the National Institutes of Health, while the US Department of Education has also launched investigations into 60 schools to see if they’re violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by failing to protect Jewish students.

Republicans, meanwhile, are seeking to increase the tax rate on wealthy endowment, linking the effort to tackle antisemitism on college campuses as well as opposition to DEI policies.

In response, schools including Harvard, Stanford and Penn have implemented hiring freezes and are reviewing spending, with Penn warning “the scope and pace of the possible disruptions we face may make them more severe than those of previous challenges, such as the 2008 financial crisis or the Covid pandemic.”

After the Trump administration announced the funding cuts at Columbia, interim president Katrina Armstrong outlined changes, including strengthening its disciplinary process and stepping up efforts to combat antisemitism.

“Columbia is taking the government’s action very seriously,” Armstrong said in a statement. “I want to assure the entire Columbia community that we are committed to working with the federal government to address their legitimate concerns.”

Last week, Columbia said four of its students had been suspended and restricted from campus after disruptions at Barnard College, an affiliated women’s college. After the funding cuts to Columbia was announced, Mahmoud Khalil, who helped lead anti-Israel protests at the school, was detained by immigration authorities, prompting protest marches in New York City and a petition that has been signed more than 2.6 million times.

Despite recent measures, hedge fund manager Dan Loeb, who attended Columbia as a student, posted on X on Wednesday that regardless of his love for the institution and the role it played in his education, he would “never recommend the school” today. He slammed Armstrong and the board of trustees for the university’s “failed state.”

On the West Coast, UCLA’s new chancellor, Julio Frenk, also launched an initiative to combat antisemitism.

Harvard last week reportedly took action against librarian Jonathan Tuttle after he was filmed taking down a poster of Israeli children who were killed after they were taken hostage by Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the US government.

Sherri Ann Charleston, Harvard’s chief diversity and inclusion officer, said in a statement that vandalism and violations of the university’s rules are an “affront to the principles of open and constructive expression and dialog that undergird our community.”

At Yale, Helyeh Doutaghi was placed on leave after reports alleging that she has links to Samidoun, a group that the Biden administration in October labeled a “sham charity” serving as a fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, also considered a terrorist organization.

Doutaghi, in a statement on X, said that Yale’s actions “constitute a blatant act of retaliation against Palestinian solidarity” and described the attacks as “defamatory smears amplified by fascist trolls.”

The school in a statement said it takes the allegations seriously and is undertaking a potential unlawful-conduct investigation.

“Such an action is never initiated based on a person’s protected speech,” said law school spokesperson Alden Ferro.


Some of the moves to limit protests and target foreign students have raised concern on campuses. Professors at the University of Southern California signed a petition urging the school to protect students, staff and faculty in response to Trump’s measures.

“This executive order has many alarming elements, including the exhortation to “monitor for and report activities by alien students,” according to the petition. “It weaponizes antisemitism to attack intellectual and academic freedom as well as the university writ large. Moreover, it does not clearly distinguish between antisemitism and anti-Zionism, which will have a chilling effect on free speech.”

“Almost all” the professors are either Jewish or work in the Jewish Studies department, according to USC professor of sociology Nina Eliasoph.

Richard Thomas, a Harvard classics professor, also raised concerns over threats to free speech, especially after the arrest of Columbia activist Khalil, a green card holder.

“None of this has much to do with actual antisemitism, and a lot to do with silencing universities through fear of losing funding, and silencing students through fear of covert, extrajudicial policing,” said Thomas. “If we are seeing the political future, financial independence will be necessary for any possible future of healthy and independent higher education.”

2025-03-13T15:15:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/state-street-apollo-s-private-credit-etf-priv-sees-minimal-inflows,"State Street Corp. and Apollo Global Management Inc.’s hotly anticipated private credit exchange-traded fund has been met with muted demand so far from investors.

The SPDR SSGA Apollo IG Public & Private Credit ETF, which trades under the ticker PRIV, has posted just two days of net inflows totaling just $5 million since its Feb. 27 launch, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.

While the launch came amid a big selloff across risky assets, there are existential reasons for the less-than-warm welcome. Chief among them: a wary Securities and Exchange Commission, which took the unusual step of sending a strongly worded letter post-launch, listing concerns over the fund’s liquidity, valuation and even its name.

While the firms have since responded, investor concerns echo those of the SEC: how will inherently illiquid assets behave in a fund wrapper that trades continuously on a public stock exchange? Given that PRIV is the first of its kind, investors appear to be waiting for that answer.

All in, the ETF has roughly $55 million in assets thanks to initial funding that it started trading with and may yet grab inflows in the event broader risk sentiment returns, particularly for alternative assets. The sheer fact that the novel product is trading may prove an encouraging sign for issuers, who are looking to launch strategies with similarly innovative structures. But asset allocators are holding tight, for now.

“Investors justifiably are cautious because the whole essence of it is counterintuitive, that some third of the portfolio will be private — i.e. illiquid — but it will have all-day liquidity. Not just daily liquidity, but all-day liquidity,” Marina Gross, the head of Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said at a media roundtable last week. “I wouldn’t go near it for now. I would watch it very closely and very carefully.”

State Street Global Advisors’ Chief Business Officer Anna Paglia said that getting additional questions from the SEC post-launch “is not unique — it happens from time to time.” She pointed out that the filing for the fund had been submitted some five months prior to its debut, suggesting a “very healthy dialog with the SEC” that constituted multiple rounds of feedback from the regulators, which, she says, State Street then addressed.


“We thought the process had concluded, it had not. We got the new comments and we answered those comments within 24 hours,” she said on Thursday on Bloomberg TV. “More drama than was warranted was created in the market.”

The SEC requires that ETFs cap investments deemed illiquid at 15% of the portfolio — a bucket which includes private assets. However, PRIV suggests it could devote as much as 35% of its holdings to private credit, with a pledge from Apollo to originate a portion of the investments while also providing daily bids and price data.

Despite Apollo’s commitment, questions remain over how the assets within the portfolio will be valued and how day-to-day trading will work.

“The hesitation that I would have, at least initially, which is why I think it’s prudent to take a wait-and-see approach, is the mismatch in liquidity that you have with the ETF being instantaneously liquid and underlying not being liquid,” said Garrett Aird, vice president of investment management and research at Northwestern Mutual.

Private credit has boomed over the past several years mostly through direct corporate lending. As institutional investment has plateaued, firms have raced to draw wealth from individual investors and offer them exposure. The Bank for International Settlements warned in a report this week that the push for retail cash could create vulnerabilities within private credit due to the liquidity mismatches.

For Paglia, the last few weeks have been spent fielding questions about PRIV. It’s normal for investors to wait until a new ETF has a track record before jumping in, she said in a separate interview.

“We’re having a number of meetings about PRIV, and I think the wait-and-see approach is what we always expect when we launch active funds, because they are not as transparent and predictable as passive funds,” Paglia said. “This is very much what we believed would happen, but there is a lot of interest in the fund.”

Bain & Co. forecast last year that retail will be the fastest-growing source of capital for private assets through 2032. But it’s an open question whether ETFs will be a significant funnel for that demand.

Blackstone Inc. and Blue Owl Capital Inc. are both launching vehicles dedicated to private credit. But instead of ETFs, both have opted for interval funds, which offer quarterly withdrawals rather than intraday liquidity. Blackstone’s fund is planning to invest at least 80% of its assets in private credit.

“We do a fair amount of private credit for our clients — it is a very crowded space right now with just about every asset manager having or rolling something out. Literally daily,” said Chuck Cumello, the chief executive officer at Essex Financial Services.

“We have been investing in private credit for a few years. As of yet, we have not seen any client demand for this type of ETF,” he said, referencing the State Street fund."
2025-03-13T15:41:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/pressured-shoppers-skipping-essentials-dollar-general-ceo-says,"Dollar General Corp. has one of the best reads on low-income US shoppers, and the retailer said that they’re under so much financial strain that some are pulling back on essential items.

Our customers say their “financial situation has worsened over the last year as they have been negatively impacted by ongoing inflation,” Chief Executive Officer Todd Vasos said Thursday on a call with analysts. Some say “they have had to sacrifice even on the necessities.”

Lower-income Americans have been feeling the pinch after years of rising costs, high borrowing costs and slowing pay gains. US consumer sentiment sharply deteriorated last month on expectations that President Donald Trump’s trade wars will push prices higher. And retailers are warning of weakening demand this year.

Dollar General, which on Thursday reported fourth-quarter sales above Wall Street expectations, said it’s also seeing the “trade down” effect return. That’s typically when consumers with higher incomes shift to shopping at discounters.

Walmart Inc. has also pointed to consumers being pressured, with its CEO recently saying some Americans are running out of money before the end of the month and turning to smaller pack sizes for consumer goods."

The company has sent notices to employees who are likely to be affected, people with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified as a public announcement hasn’t been made.

The job cuts are in line with the company’s disposals and other restructuring plans, Anglo American said in response to queries. Consultations have just begun and the number of people affected is yet to be determined, the company said.

Anglo began restructuring the business last year after it had to fend off a $43 billion take-over bid by rival BHP Group Ltd.

It has sold its coking coal and nickel businesses and is on track to spin off most of its controlling holding in Anglo American Platinum Ltd. by June, the company said. It also plans to either sell or hold an initial public offering for its De Beers unit, which is the world’s biggest diamond company.

Most of its corporate staff are in South Africa where the company was founded by Ernest Oppenheimer in 1917 to exploit the world’s biggest gold fields, the Witwatersrand. During the isolation brought by apartheid it expanded from mining into businesses ranging from banking to paper making.


After an initial round of divestments it moved its headquarters to London in 1998.

The company slashed jobs at its main South African corporate office in 2023 and later fired workers at its iron ore unit, which it is retaining, and at Amplats."
2025-03-13T15:58:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/democrats-in-standoff-with-gop-as-us-shutdown-deadline-nears,"Senate Democrats dug in Thursday in their standoff with Republicans over Elon Musk’s cost-cutting crusade as a Saturday US government shutdown neared with no resolution in sight.

Several moderate Senate Democrats signaled on Thursday they’ll vote to block the bill, preferring instead a four-week funding patch that would allow time for cross-party talks on language to rein in Musk and scrap a $1 billion cut to the District of Columbia budget.

The two Democratic senators from the swing state of Arizona — Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego — as well as New Mexico’s Ben Ray Lujan, New Jersey Andy Kim and Virginia’s Mark Warner support a blockade of the bill.

Democrats’ most dedicated and active voters are clamoring for a confrontation to constrain President Donald Trump and Musk’s efforts to dismantle entire federal agencies. But many moderates had been wary of shutting down the government and risking being blamed for interrupting government services.

Many of them prefer to join battle over protecting Medicaid or other broadly supported government benefits.

But the tone in the Senate, particularly among these key moderates, is becoming less conciliatory the closer the shutdown deadline comes.


“I know what I’m doing,” Gallego told reporters on Thursday afternoon.

The statements came amid a heated Senate Democratic lunch on the topic where shouting was heard for the third day in a row.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer declared a day earlier his party would block a Republican spending bill to avert the impending shutdown and urged the GOP to accept a Democratic plan to provide funding through April 11 instead.

Trump said Thursday afternoon he is open to direct negotiations with Schumer on the funding package.

“If they need me, I’m there, 100%,” Trump told reporters at the White House.

The Senate Republican leader, John Thune, told reporters earlier Thursday he was waiting for Democrats to offer a deal on amendment votes to avert a shutdown. Confident that it would fail, he said he is willing to allow a vote on the Democratic proposal if Democrats allow a vote on the House passed bill.

Senate moderates continued to be coy about whether they would block the House bill if the shutdown deadline was imminent. Senators Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Elissa Slotkin all demurred when asked.

The stalemate heightens the risk of a shutdown at a time financial markets are hyper-sensitive to new disruption as US stocks have been whipsawed by Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff threats. But traders Thursday morning were focused primarily on the latest turn in the trade conflict, which Trump threatened to escalate with a 200% tariff on European wine, rather than the shutdown drama.

It’s unclear whether Schumer can muster support from moderate Democrats to carry out his threat, much less sustain a blockade over an extended shutdown — which could cause political blowback and hurt already embattled federal workers.

The legislation to fund the government is a rare moment of leverage for Democrats, who have lost the White House and don’t control either chamber of Congress. But Republican leaders rebuffed Democrats’ efforts to include any constraints on Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.

House Republicans passed legislation on Tuesday to finance the government through Sept. 30, daring moderate Democrats in the Senate to block the measure over objections it fails to constrain Musk. House Republicans then left Washington for a two-week break.

In the Senate, 60 votes are needed to cut off procedural obstacles and Republicans only have 53 senators in the chamber.

Thune told reporters Wednesday evening he is open to allowing Democrats a vote on a short-term spending bill if they give consent to all final votes on the House measure, known as a continuing resolution, before the deadline.

“In the end, we want to fund the government. Hopefully they do, too,” Thune said."
2025-03-13T16:00:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/mortgage-rates-in-us-increase-for-first-time-in-eight-weeks,"Mortgage rates in the US rose for the first time since the middle of January, keeping borrowing costs high for buyers trying to break into the market.

The average for 30-year loans was 6.65%, up from 6.63% last week, Freddie Mac said in a statement Thursday.

Mortgage rates have been hovering above 6.5% for the past five months, raising questions about how the housing market will fare during its typically busiest season. While some early-stage measures of demand are starting to pick up, sales are still struggling. In the four weeks through March 9, contracts to buy previously owned homes were down 6.1% from a year earlier, according to Redfin Corp.

“Lower mortgage rates have brought some house hunters who were waiting for costs to come down off the sidelines,” said Chen Zhao, Redfin’s economic research lead. “But they haven’t yet led to more sales because prospective buyers are still figuring out whether lower payments are enough to justify a home purchase in today’s uncertain economy.”

The Federal Reserve, which is scheduled to meet next week, has been monitoring inflation data closely. Tariff battles between the US and other countries have raised the risk that the cost of consumer goods will rise. For now, inflation remains more controlled, with a measure of consumer prices increasing at the slowest pace in four months.

“Tariffs that do make their way onto the books will add to inflation, but we may not see their effect in the CPI for several months,” said Joel Berner, Realtor.com senior economist."
2025-03-13T16:01:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/europe-must-bolster-space-launch-capacity-to-counter-us-reliance,"Europe must expand its own space launch services in order to create more capacity in the industry as slots provided by SpaceX fill up, a manager at the region’s largest defense contractor said.

For now, the easiest, cheapest and most reliable way to launch satellites into space is using rockets from Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Elizabeth Seward, who heads BAE Systems Plc’s space strategy and future business, said in an interview in London. SpaceX currently doesn’t have enough capacity to accommodate the high demand, and it prioritises US missions alongside its own launches, pushing other customers down the priority list, she added.

Space is part of a broader push to wean Europe’s dependence off the US, which dominates global industries from defense equipment to space launchers to artificial intelligence. Europe has often piggybacked on US space missions as it hasn’t yet established a reliable launch system that can deliver its own payloads into orbit. There were more than 130 launches using SpaceX rockets last year, compared with just three in Europe.

“We’re not very quick on our regulation and policy,” Seward said at a space conference in London this week. “That’s an area we still need to work on.” The UK defense company is hopeful that Europe will open up its own avenues to access space, making the region more resilient, she added.

The European Space Agency launched the first commercial mission of the Ariane 6 rocket last week from French Guiana, but the program has been mired in years of delays and cost overruns. Ariane 6 is intended to compete with SpaceX’s Falcon 9, which has already performed dozens of missions so far this year.

“A new security reality is dawning in which Europe cannot afford to assume continued shared access to the security-critical strategic space capabilities of its allies,” said Greg Sadlier, the co-founder of space consultancy know.space.

Europe has had a “big wake-up call” from the geopolitical realignments that have taken place since Donald Trump returned to the White House this year, and the region must become less reliant on the US, Virgin Group Founder Richard Branson told an audience on Tuesday at Space-Comm Expo.

The UK has a fully-licensed spaceport in the Shetland Islands called SaxaVord, as well as a number of rocket manufacturers that are working toward their first orbital launches, such as Skyrora and Orbex. Branson’s Virgin Orbit was slated to be the first orbital launch from British soil, but the company shut down shortly after a mission from Spaceport Cornwall in England failed to reach orbit in January 2023.

Skyrora has seen more interest for its launch services from large satellite companies in Europe and the Middle East, which were previously looking to the US for launch, Director of Operations Derek Harris said on Wednesday in an interview at the conference. This is because of delays to US launch slots and the concern over potential tariffs, he said.

BAE’s space unit is building Azalea, a satellite cluster scheduled to launch onboard SpaceX’s Falcon 9 in October. The satellites are designed to also fit on launch vehicles made by Orbex, which plans to blast off its first rocket from SaxaVord Spaceport later this year.


“If we could launch from Scotland and we could just put it on the back of a lorry, how brilliant would that be,” Seward said.

As part of its review of Exxon’s $63 billion takeover of Pioneer Natural Resources Co, the antitrust agency said last year it found evidence Sheffield sought to communicate with OPEC and US peers about oil pricing and output. The FTC ultimately approved the sale but barred Sheffield from joining Exxon’s board.

Sheffield sued the FTC in January, alleging the agency’s settlement barring him from the board violated his constitutional rights. But a second option emerged after Donald Trump became president, Sheffield said in an interview on the sidelines at the CERAWeek by S&P Global conference.

Sheffield said he could approach the FTC if a third Republican commissioner, Mark Meador, is appointed. It’s unclear how Meador, Trump’s nominee to fill the third Republican seat on the five-member commission, would ultimately vote on such a request.


“Right now, it’s a 2-to-2 vote, so if we asked them to vacate the order, the two Republicans have already stated it’s illegal and baseless,” Sheffield said in an interview, signaling that a third Republican could swing things in his favor.

“If I go down that direction, then we’ll drop the lawsuit in federal court,” he said.

Sheffield said if that happened, it doesn’t mean Exxon has to put him on the board or that he would join it.

“I’m doing it to vacate the order and clear my name” Sheffield said."

Versace, who took over the role in 1997 from her late brother Gianni after he died, will remain involved as chief brand ambassador, supporting the Italian company’s philanthropic efforts, the company said Thursday. Former Miu Miu executive Dario Vitale will succeed her.

The decision comes at a key moment for Versace as rival Prada SpA closes in on a deal to buy the company from Capri Holdings Ltd. after agreeing to pay nearly €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion), Bloomberg reported. Prada and Capri could finalize a deal this month, according to people familiar with the situation.

Donatella Versace, 69, has had creative control of the company since her brother was murdered in 1997, helping to keep the brand relevant in the modern age. “It has been the greatest honor of my life to carry on my brother Gianni’s legacy,” she said in a statement on Instagram.


Vitale left his position as design and image director at Prada-owned Miu Miu earlier this year, and will start his new role on April 1, Versace and Capri said."

Prices have surged around 12% since late December, reaching €268.48 ($291.92) per 100 kilograms this month, the priciest since at least 2012, with higher feed costs adding to the shortages caused by avian influenza infections.

The EU is not alone in falling short of eggs, a cheap protein source and a breakfast staple in many diets. The US is also battling soaring prices and seeking supplies from across the globe after its worst-ever bird flu outbreak killed millions of hens.

Europe’s egg shortfall comes as consumers seek out cheaper protein alternatives to meat, according to Dineo Komane, an egg sector reporter at market intelligence provider Expana. Also, the Netherlands, a top egg-exporting country, has scaled down its livestock industry in recent years to cut carbon emissions.

Still, the jump in prices hasn’t deterred European consumers so far, and “retail reports continue to show that demand for eggs is increasing, leaving fewer eggs available for wholesale,” Komane added.

However, with Easter approaching, a holiday focused around eggs and large family gatherings over food, global demand is expected to pick up, squeezing tight supplies and compounding the pressure on prices.


“Historically prices tend to go up toward Easter before stabilizing,” Komane said, “That’s what you would expect, but whether that price drop will be observed this year remains to be seen.”"

Trinity and Certares are seasoned lodging investors that acquired the property for $174 million in a 2021 deal that helped mark a recovery in investor demand for hotel assets following Covid. The 352-room hotel is part of a mixed-use development in Miami’s Brickell neighborhood, where strong demand has pushed office rents to prices more typically seen in Manhattan.

Household net worth increased $164 billion, or 0.1% from the prior quarter, to $169 trillion, a Federal Reserve report showed Thursday. The value of Americans’ equity holdings rose nearly $264 billion. The overall gain was restrained by a decline in the value of real estate.

Shareholders largely benefited from a post-election surge in stock prices as investors piled into the so-called Trump trade, betting the Republican would enact pro-business policies during his second administration.

However, stocks have mostly reversed course in recent weeks — wiping out $5 trillion in gains — as Wall Street sours on the outlook amid concerns that the Trump administration’s tariffs are raising the odds of a recession. The recent hit to stock portfolios risks causing upper-income Americans, who have largely been responsible for robust consumer-spending growth, to cut back.


The Fed’s report showed that consumers boosted their borrowing at a 3.1% annualized pace, the fastest since the second quarter of 2023. Consumer non-mortgage credit accelerated to a 2.6% pace, while mortgage debt eased.

Business debt outstanding decelerated to about a 1% annualized rate, the slowest pace in a year. In the public sector, state and local government debt shrank by the most in two years.

Meanwhile, deposits held by households and nonprofit organizations, which includes savings and checking accounts and money market funds, rose by $578 billion — the most since 2021, to a record $19.4 trillion."
2025-03-13T16:12:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2025-03-13/jewish-group-fills-trump-tower-s-lobby-to-protest-effort-to-deport-pro-palestinian-columbia-activist,"NEW YORK (AP) — Demonstrators from a Jewish group filled the lobby of Trump Tower on Thursday to denounce the immigration arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist who helped lead protests against Israel at Columbia University.

The demonstrators from Jewish Voice for Peace wore red shirts reading “Jews say stop arming Israel” and held up banners as they chanted “Bring Mahmoud home now!"" on the lower level of the Fifth Avenue building's public atrium.

After warning the protesters to leave, police said they arrested 98 people who stayed on various charges, including trespassing, obstruction and resisting arrest.

Khalil, a 30-year-old permanent U.S. resident who is married to an American citizen and who hasn't been charged with breaking any laws, was arrested outside his New York City apartment Saturday and faces deportation. He's being held at an immigration detention center in Louisiana.

President Donald Trump has said Khalil’s arrest was the first “of many to come” and vowed on social media to deport students who he said engage in “pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity.” The White House didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment about the Trump Tower demonstration.

Among those who took part in Thursday's protest was actor Debra Winger, who wasn't arrested. She accused the Trump administration of having “no interest in Jewish safety” and “co-opting antisemitism.”

“I’m just standing up for my rights, and I’m standing up for Mahmoud Khalil, who has been abducted illegally and taken to an undisclosed location,"" Winger told The Associated Press, referring to how Khalil's attorney didn't know his whereabouts immediately following his arrest. ""Does that sound like America to you?”

Protester Sophie Edelhart, a Barnard graduate who studies Yiddish as part of a PhD program in Canada, said the building — with its golden escalator that Trump rode before announcing his 2016 presidential run — was a symbolic target.

Trump Tower serves as headquarters for the Trump Organization and is where the president stays when he is in New York. The skyscraper often attracts demonstrations, both against and in support of its namesake, though protests inside are less common. The multi-story atrium is accessible to the public and connects visitors to eateries including the Trump Grill.

Khalil’s supporters say his arrest is an attack on free speech and have staged protests elsewhere in the city and around the country, including outside a Manhattan courthouse during a brief hearing on his case Wednesday.

Columbia University was a focal point of the pro-Palestinian protest movement that swept across U.S. college campuses last year and led to more than 2,000 arrests.

On Thursday, Khalil and seven students identified by pseudonyms filed a lawsuit seeking to block a congressional committee from obtaining Columbia and Barnard College disciplinary records for students involved in campus protests.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan against the schools, the Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce and its chairman, Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., seeks a permanent injunction barring Congress from forcing the schools to provide the records and the universities from complying with the demand.

The committee sent a letter last month demanding that Columbia and Barnard provide the records or risk billions of dollars in federal funding. The plaintiffs contend that the committee is abusing its power in an attempt “to chill and suppress speech and association based on the viewpoint expressed” and that its investigation “threatens to significantly infringe on First Amendment rights.”

“This lawsuit changes nothing,” Walberg said in a statement emailed by a committee spokesperson, adding that the requested information “is critical to its consideration of legislation on this issue” and it efforts to “hold schools accountable for their failures to address rampant antisemitism on our college campuses.”

Barnard spokespeople didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Columbia declined to discuss the pending litigation.

Khalil, whose wife is pregnant with their first child, finished his requirements for a Columbia master’s degree in December."
2025-03-13T16:25:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/venezuela-bonds-whipsawed-by-changing-policies,"A series of policy flip-flops between the US and Venezuela is hitting the nation’s bond market with a fresh bout of volatility, forcing investors to recalibrate bets on the outlook for a $60 billion debt restructuring.

Government notes — in default since 2017 — have alternated between days-long rallies and sharp selloffs over the past month as money managers parse announcements by President Donald Trump and his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro. The latest, in which Venezuela agreed to restart repatriation flights from the US, was seen as Maduro acquiescing to one of Washington’s top agenda items — migration from Latin America.

That decision, announced Thursday, fueled a third positive day for some bonds and added to a wild run this year. Investors are clinging to hopes that Trump will ultimately soften his stance toward Maduro, a longtime adversary, opening the path for the country to normalize international relations and embark on what’s expected to be one of the largest and most complex debt reworks in the developing world.

Bonds due in 2027 are up more than 17% this year — far outpacing the 2% gain for an index of emerging-market, high-yield debt. The rally has held up even after Trump shocked markets by ending a Biden-era oil deal that allowed Chevron Corp. to pump oil in Venezuela.

“Volatility is the name of the game under Trump,” said Guillermo Guerrero, a strategist at EMFI Securities. “The bonds have not fully backtracked their recent gains, which implies that there is still an expectation of more twists in the road ahead.”

Trump’s return to the White House kicked off a period of optimism for the beleaguered market, with investors rushing to scoop up government and state oil company bonds — which are among the cheapest in emerging markets. A change in policy with the new administration, they wagered, would result in a lifting of economic sanctions, ultimately leading to a debt rework and a big payout on their lottery ticket-like bets.

The case got a boost in late January when Richard Grenell, the US envoy in charge of special situations, flew to Caracas and struck a deal with Maduro, securing the release of American prisoners held in the country. The bonds due in 2027 — which are among the most liquid — rose to nearly 22 cents on the dollar for the first time in a year, according to indicative pricing compiled by Bloomberg.

Trump brought the rally to a screeching halt with his unexpected decision last week to revoke the Chevron license. The permit allowed the US driller to pump oil despite the sanctions.

Prices have since stabilized at around 19 cents on the dollar this week as investors wait for the back and forth to play out. Barclays on Thursday kept its market-weight recommendation on the debt due, in part, to the difficulty in assessing the likelihood of a political transition, according to a note to clients.

For Francesco Marani, who holds and trades Venezuela and PDVSA debt for Spanish-based Auriga Global Investors SV SA, the recent back-and-forth between Washington and Caracas has done little to change his view that “normalization is the most likely outcome.”

“Regardless of the threat to oil licenses, the market has proved to be really solid,” he said. “Investors seem to believe that normalization is more likely than a disruption of the relationship.”


“Trump does not appear ideologically wedded to his positions,” said Jason Keene, a strategist at Barclays. “He can definitely turn around and make a deal at a different point in time.”

A recent rally in Lebanon bonds is also providing support, as it makes debt from the government and state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA look cheap, Keene said.

2025-03-13T16:26:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/putin-says-he-wants-to-talk-to-trump-on-us-truce-plan-in-ukraine,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said he wants to discuss a proposed ceasefire in Ukraine with his US counterpart Donald Trump, though he warned that any truce should lead to a long-term resolution of the war.

“The idea itself is correct and we certainly support it, but there are issues that we need to discuss,” Putin said at a Moscow news conference Thursday. “We need to talk to our American colleagues and partners about this, maybe call President Trump and discuss it with him, but we support the idea of ​​ending this conflict by peaceful means.”

Despite the ambiguity in Putin’s comments, Trump took an optimistic view. “We’re getting word that things are going OK in Russia,” Trump told reporters at the White House during a visit by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. The president added, though, that “it doesn’t mean anything until we hear what the final outcome is” and that if Russia doesn’t sign on to the truce “that’ll be a very disappointing moment for the world.”

Trump said the US has started discussing outlines of a final agreement with Ukraine, including land that might be kept or forfeited and which side would keep a large power plant. “It’s not an easy process,” Trump said. He didn’t elaborate on the disputed plant, but the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant — Europe’s largest — has been seized by Russian forces since early in the war.

Putin spoke ahead of talks Thursday with Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, as the US seeks to persuade the Russian leader to join the 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine said it’s ready to accept. The agreement hammered out at talks between top US and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday has turned the spotlight onto Russia in efforts to halt the fighting and begin negotiations to end the more than three-year-long war.


“We agree with the proposals to stop hostilities, but we start from the position that this cessation should lead to a long-term peace and eliminate the causes of this crisis,” Putin said. “Then there arise questions over monitoring and verification” of any truce along an almost 2,000 kilometer-long (1,250 mile) front line, he said.

Zelenskiy’s Response
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy ridiculed Putin’s response in his nightly address to his nation. “Now we have all heard from Russia very predictable, very manipulative words from Putin in response to the idea of ​​silence on the front – he is actually preparing a refusal as of now,” Zelenskiy said. “Putin, of course, is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war, wants to kill Ukrainians.”

Putin’s forces are in an increasingly strong position. Ukraine will likely have to fully withdraw from the Russian region of Kursk, potentially as soon as within a week, according to an official familiar with a US assessment.

Ukrainians moved into Kursk last fall, hoping to use it as a bargaining chip in negotiations with Moscow, but Russian forces have been steadily gaining in reclaiming the land.

Putin’s foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, said earlier Thursday that Russia wanted a long-term solution and not a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, the Interfax news agency reported.

There were no plans for a phone conversation between Putin and Trump on Thursday, Ushakov said, according to the Tass news service.

2025-03-13T16:29:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/putin-says-us-deal-may-help-boost-russian-gas-flows-to-europe,"European natural gas futures plunged after Russian President Vladimir Putin said a potential energy cooperation deal between Moscow and Washington could boost his country’s fuel flows to Europe.

The region has taken steps to cut its reliance on Russian gas since the invasion of Ukraine and receives only a fraction of its previous pipeline flows. But that hasn’t stopped speculation over their return in recent weeks as US President Donald Trump ramps up efforts to end the war.

“If, say, the US and Russia agree on cooperation in the energy sector, then a gas pipeline for Europe could be ensured,” Putin said at a briefing in Moscow, broadcast by Rossiya 24 state TV on Thursday. “And this will benefit Europe, as it will receive cheap Russian gas.”

Whether Russian pipeline gas eventually makes a comeback in Europe is uncertain. The region has been drafting a plan to phase out imports of Russian energy by 2027, though there have been some voices calling for deliveries to return amid concerns about high energy prices weighing on the economy.

Meanwhile, a peace deal to end the three-year war would likely be a prerequisite for energy cooperation. Putin said Thursday he wants to discuss a proposed ceasefire in Ukraine with Trump, though he warned that any truce should lead to a long-term resolution of the war.

Benchmark gas prices in Europe fell as much as 5% after Putin’s remarks, before closing little changed.

Prior to the invasion, Russia was Europe’s biggest supplier of gas, shipping the fuel used for heating and power generation through several routes to various countries. Many of the ties — and the infrastructure — have been lost.

Companies like Uniper SE and OMV AG have terminated contracts with Gazprom PJSC and many governments would be reluctant to sign new deals with the firm. While the EU recently delayed publishing its roadmap for getting rid of Russian energy, the European Commission said the plans are still being prepared.

Nord Stream, a direct link between Russia and Germany, was damaged in explosions in September 2022. One of the two Nord Stream 2 pipelines remained intact but that system has never been certified for use by Germany. Another pipeline runs through Poland, but Russia cut flows through the route in 2022 and it’s been entangled in a dispute between Moscow and Warsaw.

Finally, restoration of transit via Ukraine would require what have historically been lengthy negotiations between Gazprom and its counterpart Naftogaz of Ukraine.

The Kremlin will likely offer significant price discounts to regain access to some markets, according to Chris Weafer, chief executive officer of consultancy Macro-Advisory.

“We have seen the Kremlin use price discounting for a whole range of materials to gain a foothold in markets or for political barter. Expect the same approach with Germany and with other EU customers,” he said last month. “But there will be no return to business as usual. Nobody, either in Europe or in Russia, expects to see a return to pre-2022 volumes.”"
2025-03-13T16:30:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/brookfield-lennar-and-toll-partner-for-la-rebuilding-effort,"A group of homebuilders that includes Brookfield Residential, Lennar Corp. and Toll Brothers Inc. are teaming up to assist in the reconstruction of homes in areas burned by January’s Los Angeles area wildfires.

The companies aim to create a so-called Builders Alliance to help speed up efficiency and slash costs. The group detailed plans for a portal that displaced residents could use to select from a limited menu of home plans, according to a presentation seen by Bloomberg News.

By partnering with other companies, the builders would seek to acquire materials at bulk discounts and provide temporary housing for as many as 3,000 tradesmen to maximize productivity, according to Adrian Foley, chief executive officer of Brookfield Residential, which builds in the US and Canada.

The group would also work with government agencies to gain a more streamlined permitting process, according to the presentation. The aim of the alliance is to help get more scale to make it speed up the reconstruction of homes in the areas devastated by the fires, Foley said.


“Our goal is to increase the likelihood of rebuilding by driving down costs,” Foley said in an interview.

The Palisades and Eaton wildfires in the Los Angeles area destroyed about 11,000 single-family homes and killed at least 29 people. In total, the blazes caused as much as $131 billion in property and capital losses. Dozens of burned Los Angeles lots have already been put on the market by displaced homeowners who lack the money or time to rebuild.

Reconstruction timelines have dragged on for years after earlier wildfires in California and Hawaii, adding to hardships for households with fewer resources, according to an Urban Institute report.

The alliance is participating in a LA Rebuilding Advisory Committee, which is led by the Urban Land Institute, and real estate centers at the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Southern California. Other companies in the alliance include Thomas James Homes, Woodside Homes and Landsea Homes Corp., according to the presentation.

The committee is also discussing public-private partnerships to help with financing for infrastructure, such as underground power lines and water mains, as well as ways to secure insurance coverage for property owners.

Aside from keeping costs down, it’s unclear how builders plan to address one of the other main concerns of many homeowners: rebuilding in a way that preserves the character of the neighborhoods that burned. Many residents bridle at the idea of putting cookie-cutter subdivisions in the Palisades and Altadena, where diverse families and housing types have flourished for generations.

Residents using the alliance to build a home will pay for construction, permitting, landscaping and other costs, including a fee of about 15% for the builders’ services, according to Foley and Randy Johnson, a former Brookfield Residential executive who’s now working with Los Angeles Chief Recovery Officer Steve Soboroff.

Universal Approach
By relying on economies of scale, the builders expect that they can deliver homes for as little as $300 a square foot for a home built with a slab foundation on a flat lot, according to Foley. That compares with the $1,000 a square foot price that custom-built homes can cost.


Providing temporary housing for construction labor is key to gaining efficiency, especially in the Palisades area, Foley said. Without accommodations, most workers would need to spend hours commuting to sites, cutting into productivity.

Nick Norvilas, division president of Toll Brothers in Los Angeles, said in an emailed statement that the company remains committed to helping the community rebuild.

The alliance said it’ll be key to sign up large numbers of residents for the program to speed up construction and work with the efficiency of an assembly line.

“It’s going to take a universal approach,” Mike Forsum, chief operating officer of Landsea Homes, said in an interview."
2025-03-13T16:32:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/six-federal-agencies-must-rehire-fired-workers-judge-orders,"A San Francisco federal judge ordered the Trump administration to rehire thousands of the government’s newest employees who were terminated in February.

Judge William Alsup of the US District Court for the Northern District of California issued an injunction from the bench on Thursday finding the Office of Personnel Management’s order to federal agency heads to fire probationary employees was illegal.

“It is a sad day when our government would fire a good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that is a lie,” Alsup said. “That should not have been done in our country.”

The order requires the departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Interior, Agriculture, and Treasury to rehire the employees who were laid off around Feb. 13 at the direction of the OPM, the federal government’s HR department.

The judge called the OPM’s template termination letter for agencies a “sham.” Each of the agencies must submit a list of terminated probationary employees to the court within a week explaining what has been done for each, Alsup said.


The ruling is a major blow to the Trump administration’s campaign to quickly shrink the size of the federal workforce. Federal worker layoffs are expected to reach into the hundreds of thousands in coming weeks.

Alsup had previously ordered a temporary pause on any additional agency layoffs at the direction of OPM or its acting director Charles Ezell.

It’s likely the government will appeal Thursday’s order. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt in a statement said the Trump administration would “immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order.”

“The president has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch—singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the president’s agenda,” she said.

Judge’s Criticism
At the hearing Thursday, Alsup criticized the government’s handling of the firings and the subsequent litigation. He pointed to evidence of agencies firing employees under the auspices of low performance when in fact they had just received glowing reviews.

The judge, a Bill Clinton appointee, also condemned the government’s decision to refuse to make Ezell available to testify on Thursday about the decision-making behind the OPM’s directive to agencies. The acting director had submitted a written declaration under oath to the court explaining OPM’s decision, but the government later rescinded the declaration after Alsup ordered Ezell to testify and face cross examination.

Ezell should have faced cross examination so that “we get to the truth,” Alsup told the government’s attorney at the Thursday hearing.


“I tend to doubt that you’re telling me the truth,” he said.

“It upsets me,” Alsup said. “I’ve been serving in or on this court for over 50 years” and “you’re giving me press releases, sham documents” instead of live witnesses, he said.

Trump’s press secretary and the OPM didn’t immediately return requests for comment. The plaintiffs called it an “important victory” for federal workers.

“We’re going to keep holding this administration accountable whenever and wherever they try to undermine the rights of the people of the United States under the cynical guise of reform,” said Norm Eisen, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs.

Options Outside Court
Federal employees are finding other openings to overturn the terminations.

The Merit Systems Protection Board, which mediates disputes between federal workers and their employers, ordered the USDA to temporarily reinstate more than 5,000 terminated employees while an independent commission investigates their firing.

The future of that commission, the Office of the Special Counsel, is up in the air after Trump fired its leader Hampton Dellinger, who recently withdrew his lawsuit challenging the termination.

Trump also fired MSPB Member Cathy Harris, a Democrat, making it harder for a few weeks for the board to make decisions. A federal judge reinstated her.

The Trump administration is appealing that ruling. The typically three-member panel now has one Republican and one Democrat, after the third member’s term expired. Trump has the opportunity to give the board a Republican majority by nominating a third member.

Four law firms are separately urging the MSPB to reinstate workers fired by 19 agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. The San Francisco judge didn’t include either agency in his Thursday order.

Alsup has played a role in halting Trump administration action before. In 2018, the judge temporarily blocked the first administration from rescinding the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program protecting the children of undocumented immigrants. That case ultimately reached the US Supreme Court, where the justices affirmed the Alsup’s decision.

Altshuler Berzon LLP and State Democracy Defenders Fund represent the plaintiffs. The US Department of Justice represents OPM."

The S&P 500 is down more than 9% from a recent high on fears of a recession and trade-war risks. Everyone, of course, hates to see their portfolios decline. But the economic consequences could be severe if baby boomers, in particular, see their investments continue to shrink.

Much of the cohort, born between 1946 and 1964, is in the early years of retirement, or preparing to leave the workforce. And if they were to suffer persistent and deep losses while needing to withdraw money for living expenses it’s likely their portfolios would never fully recover — a scenario experts call sequence of return risk.

“Early losses while withdrawing funds can severely impact a portfolio’s longevity,” said Tomas Geoghegan, founder of Beacon Hill Private Wealth. “It’s one of the biggest but most underappreciated risks in retirement.”

The phenomenon is most dangerous when a portfolio is heavily invested in equities and an early retiree makes regular withdrawals during a prolonged downturn. The investments, already battered, contract as the assets are sold into a down market. And when the eventual rebound comes, the remaining pot of assets isn’t large enough to help the portfolio fully recover.

Should this happen to many baby boomers — in the event the recent selloff persists — the US economy might feel it. Not only would the wealthiest generation be inclined to spending less in retirement overall, but they could be forced to sell even more of their assets to meet living expenses.

While the stock market has been turbulent in recent weeks, the good news for new retirees is that periods of extended losses — the kind needed to trigger sequence of return risk — remain uncommon. Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist for Morningstar, points to four periods since 1926 when losses persisted for at least two years straight: 1929 to 1932, 1939 to 1941, 1973 to 1974 and 2000 to 2002.

Giving an example of how a 65-year-old retiree could have been hit in 2000, Arnott said a $1 million portfolio invested all in equities would have declined to $644,000 by 2020, assuming an initial withdrawal of $40,000 and annual increases for inflation.

Of course, this is a somewhat extreme case — most don’t retire with 100% in equities, and $1 million is far more than most Americans save. But Arnott said that if the bad years had came later in retirement, the value of the same portfolio could have been nearly $2.7 million after 20 years.

What to Do
Experts say sequence of return risk is most threatening in the years leading up to retirement and in the first five years after leaving the workforce. So, aside from maintaining a balanced 60/40-type portfolio, one way to mitigate the risk is to divide investments into buckets based on when you plan to spend the money.

Treasury bills or money market funds could be in the short-term bucket covering three or so years of expenses, while risker assets with more growth potential would be in the medium- and long-term buckets.

A second way to cope would be to buy a ladder of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) for the first five years of retirement, Arnott said.

And a third way is to adjust portfolio withdrawals roughly in line with performance. This would mean not taking the same amount (often adjusted for inflation) out of portfolios during a time when the markets are down, but being able to, within reason, pull more from portfolios in times of market gains. Planners call this the “guardrail” approach, and it’s a variation on the old guideline about withdrawing about 4% from a portfolio over 30 years to have a 90% chance of not outliving one’s portfolio."
2025-03-13T16:40:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/as-wall-street-gets-worried-retail-crowd-keeps-buying-us-stocks,"Even as Donald Trump’s trade war sends the US stock market hurtling toward a correction, the individual investors who rode the bull run to record highs haven’t yet given up their faith.

The so-called retail investors poured $7.3 billion into equities in the week through Wednesday, when they boosted exposure to perennial favorites like Tesla Inc., according to Emma Wu, a global quantitative and derivatives strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

They weren’t riding the usual momentum upward. In fact, the S&P 500 Index slipped over 4% and big tech stocks gave up even more. But, unbowed, they also put billions into leveraged exchanged traded funds that magnify the returns on indexes like the Nasdaq 100 or popular funds like the ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) run by Cathie Wood.

The push reflects confidence that’s built up since the Global Financial Crisis as US equities — with a few exceptions — tended to rise year after year.

Yet — counter intuitively — that isn’t necessarily a positive sign.

Wall Street professionals have started to grow more cautious on the market, at least temporarily, as they wait to see how Trump’s series of tariff volleys and federal spending cuts affect the economy.

But individual investors tend to be the last to slash their exposure to stocks — and some say the market isn’t primed to bottom out until they have already done so. With money still flowing in, that point seems a ways off: Individuals’ stock holdings exceeded their cash positions by 50% through February, more than double the average low of past non-bear-market S&P 500 corrections since 1988, according to veteran strategist Jim Paulsen.

The buying over the past week was notable in Nvidia Corp. and Tesla, JPMorgan said, with individuals buying more than $4 billion of stock in Elon Musk’s company since last Tuesday even with the shares down nearly 20% since the start of March.

Leveraged ETFs including the ProShares UltraPro QQQ (ticker TQQQ) and Direxion Daily Semiconductors (SOXL) saw more than $1 billion of inflows each last week and steady buying over the past three days, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Wood’s ARK Innovation saw nearly $300 million of buying on Monday as a levered version of the portfolio — Tradr 2X Long Innovation ETF (ticker TARK) — saw its biggest week of inflow since 2022.


All told, ETFs delivering triple the returns of a referenced index or ETF had $2.7 billion in new wagers last week, with the majority focused on beaten-down and high-growth indexes or sectors, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Balchunas and Gina Martin Adams.

“Many have become conditioned to buying dips, a strategy that has worked for the past 15 years, so it will likely take much more to get them to sell,” the pair wrote in a note"
2025-03-13T16:40:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/mlb-s-rays-bail-on-deal-for-new-ballpark-in-st-petersburg,"The Tampa Bay Rays are backing out of a deal to build a new $1.37 billion stadium in St. Petersburg, Florida, the team announced on Thursday.

The Major League Baseball team was expected to partner with the city and Pinellas County to build a ballpark under an agreement struck late last year. It had committed to contributing $700 million of its own money, with the localities allocating $600 million of public funds.

“After careful deliberation, we have concluded we cannot move forward with a new ballpark and development project at this moment,” the team’s owner, Stu Sternberg, said in a statement posted to X. “We continue to focus on finding a ballpark solution that serves the best interests of our region, Major League Baseball and our organization.”

Under the agreement, which was approved by local officials in December after months of intense negotiations, the team would have been responsible for any cost overruns. The Rays had until March 31 to demonstrate that they could produce the $700 million they had agreed to contribute for the new site.

Local officials were left frustrated by the failed talks. “There’s no negotiating with Stu Sternberg, his word doesn’t mean much, and the quicker he sells the team the better it’ll be for everybody in the region,” said Pinellas County Commissioner Chris Latvala. “He wasted tax dollars that were spent negotiating this deal and now he just walks away.” A representative for Sternberg and the Rays declined to comment.

The prospects for a new ballpark on Florida’s west coast were rocky after Hurricane Milton flooded the area last October. The storm blew the roof off Tropicana Field, the current home of the team, and fueled concerns over the project’s timeline and costs.

The team’s lease at that stadium ends after the 2027 season, though the Rays will play next season at the spring-training facility for the New York Yankees in Tampa as repairs to Tropicana move forward. After the storm, Rays leadership called for new talks to address the funding gap that they said was created by Milton.

There are fears that the team could move to a different city. MLB Commissioner Ron Manfred has reiterated his commitment to keeping the franchise in the Tampa Bay region several times during the negotiations. But it’s unlikely that Pinellas County will help to fill the funding gap.

“I’m not sure what comes next,” said Pinellas County Commissioner Kathleen Peters, “but we’ve been very clear we’re not giving a penny more.”"

Rio, together with recycling specialist Giampaolo Group, agreed to take a minority stake in Exurban of 10% to 15%, according to an investor newsletter seen by Bloomberg.

Exurban was launched in 2022 by a group of well-known figures in the metals industry including Glencore Plc’s former head of copper and cobalt marketing, with a plan to build a $340 million facility in Indiana to recover metals including copper, gold and silver from electronic waste. Other investors include Mitsubishi Materials Corp. and MKS Pamp.

At the time, it said construction would start in 2023, but now it looks unlikely to begin before 2026, with the company planning to complete a feasibility study by the middle of this year, according to the newsletter.


The US is one of the world’s largest producers of copper scrap and exported about 600,000 tons of copper contained in scrap last year, according to analysts at Citigroup Inc. But the large premium for US copper relative to international prices caused by the threat of tariffs has already begun to discourage scrap exports, they wrote in a note last week.

“If the US could process all the copper scrap it exports domestically, that alone would reduce its net import reliance on refined metal from ~45% to ~10% all else being equal,” the Citigroup analysts wrote.

The agreement extends the current contract between the parties through the 2033-36 cycle and is valued at $3 billion, NBCUniversal and the International Olympic Committee said in a statement Thursday.

The deal includes not only media rights on all platforms in the US, but also new initiatives and projects, they said, elevating NBC to a strategic partner with the Olympics. The broadcaster will help the IOC by providing technology that supports coverage of the games and working together on digital advertising.

Comcast’s existing arrangement was scheduled to run from 2021 to 2032 and was valued at $7.65 billion, according to a statement issued when that deal was reached. The new deal covers the Salt Lake City Games in 2034 and the still-to-be chosen location for the Summer Olympics set for 2036.


The most recent Summer Games in Paris were a hit for NBC, averaging 30.6 million viewers a night in prime time across all platforms, the broadcaster said last August. The Games delivered about $1.3 billion in advertising revenue. The company saw subscribers to its Peacock streaming service rise 29% in the quarter that included the games last year.

The Covid-19 pandemic and time-zone differences made previous Games a challenging business proposition. The 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing were the least-watched in prime time on NBC."

Petronas has begun a process that may result in a sale of its 50% stake in La Amarga Chica, a venture with state-run YPF SA in the oil production heartland of Vaca Muerta, according to people familiar with the matter who couldn’t be named discussing private matters. Petronas has already been in talks with a potential suitor, one of the people said.

Petronas didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Last year, Petronas left a venture with YPF to develop a project for liquefying and exporting shale gas.

Petronas’ involvement in La Amarga Chica began in 2014, when Argentina’s shale industry was just getting started. The field’s size is about 46,000 acres, with half corresponding to each partner, according to YPF.

If the sale does go ahead, Petronas would follow Exxon Mobil Corp. in divesting from Argentine shale oil and monetizing the assets at a time when the outlook for Vaca Muerta is improving under President Javier Milei.

Equinor ASA is also eyeing the door, while TotalEnergies said this week it would sell if it could reap the sort of rich valuations that Exxon got. That’s left the stage largely to homegrown companies."
2025-03-13T16:50:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/landmark-stablecoin-bill-advances-in-senate-banking-committee,"The Senate Banking Committee advanced landmark stablecoin legislation Thursday in a major victory for the ascendant cryptocurrency industry, despite strong objections from top Democrat Elizabeth Warren.

The 18-6 vote puts a priority of President Donald Trump on a fast track in the full Senate. The bipartisan bill would govern privately issued, dollar-based stablecoins, which the industry claims will enable cheaper and faster transactions across the globe for anyone with a smartphone.

But Warren argued the bill failed to do enough to protect consumers, taxpayers or the broader economy if a stablecoin fails. “This bill begs for more bailouts,” she said.

And she criticized the bill for enabling tech billionaires like Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg to launch their own dollar-based tokens, potentially giving them and their companies more power.

She cited a Bloomberg story Thursday, which reported that a Trump crypto venture has talked to Binance about doing business, including potentially a new stablecoin. “We should be standing up to this naked corruption,” she said.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty in 2023 to anti-money laundering failures.


Republicans blocked numerous Democratic amendments, which Warren said would ban taxpayer bailouts and make it harder for child pornographers, terrorists, foreign adversaries and drug traffickers to use private stablecoins.

Backers including the bill’s lead author, Republican Bill Hagerty, said the bill already has protections and would make it harder for criminals by bringing the industry under US regulation instead of driving it overseas. They noted the law requires one-to-one reserve assets backing the stablecoins overseen by regulators.

“This is an innovative, important financial product that has safeguards built in,” said Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, a longtime crypto proponent.

New York Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand isn’t a member of the committee but is the lead Democrat supporting the bill, along with freshman Maryland Democrat Angela Alsobrooks.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump have been bullish on stablecoins, with Bessent saying they would extend dollar “dominance.” The tokens drive up demand for dollars, because they would be backed by dollars, short-term government debt or similar assets approved by regulators.

The House Financial Services Committee is working on similar legislation.

Stablecoins from the biggest issuers Tether and Circle are already used in billions of dollars of transactions a day, though traditional credit and debit cards dominate retail transactions.

The retailer lobby has also backed stablecoins in hopes they will provide more competition to existing payment networks and lower merchants’ costs.

Banks, meanwhile, would face new competition from an assortment of fintech companies looking to swipe a big chunk of their business, though some have signaled interest in issuing their own stablecoins if the legislation becomes law. Some banks also have gained business acting as custodians for stablecoin reserves.

Industry-friendly legislation to authorize a sweeping overhaul of the broader market for cryptocurrencies, most of which are backed by nothing, is also in the works but faces a tougher road.

2025-03-13T16:58:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/staley-says-erdoes-had-authority-to-drop-epstein-from-jpmorgan,"Mary Erdoes could have dropped Jeffrey Epstein as a JPMorgan Chase & Co. customer if she’d wanted, Jes Staley said as he defended his involvement in the late pedophile financier’s business with the Wall Street bank.

Giving evidence in a London court, Staley said Erdoes, head of JPMorgan’s asset and wealth management business, had “full authority to remove Epstein as a client.”

The bank cut off Epstein several months after Staley left the firm in 2013. “Mary Erdoes and others exited him as a client six years before he was charged with human trafficking,” JPMorgan said in an emailed statement, in response to queries about Staley’s comments.

The relationship between Staley and Epstein, which began while he worked for the Wall Street bank, is under scrutiny as part of Staley’s legal challenge against a lifetime ban from the UK finance industry. The executive, who went on to run Barclays Plc until 2021, has denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of Epstein’s misconduct. The Financial Conduct Authority has said he “recklessly” misled it about the nature of their friendship.


Staley said on Thursday that he’d never stopped JPMorgan’s internal teams from investigating Epstein. “Compliance and legal are required to do a full client review of a felon on an annual basis,” he said.

“From 2008 the bank should have been doing a full review of Epstein as a client,” he said. Staley said that at that time the private bank reported to Erdoes. “I was letting the bank’s legal and compliance do their job.”"
2025-03-13T17:02:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/panama-clears-first-quantum-to-ship-stockpiled-copper-from-mine,"First Quantum Minerals Ltd. was cleared to begin shipping out stockpiled copper in Panama, the latest sign authorities may be willing to negotiate a restart of the company’s giant shuttered mine.

Panama’s President Jose Raul Mulino said Thursday he has authorized the export of “ground material” from the Cobre Panama mine, referring to copper concentrate that the company has kept stockpiled at the site since it was ordered to close in 2023. He also said his government plans to start addressing the mine’s closure and its path forward next week, “God willing.”

Mulino’s comments come as Vancouver-based First Quantum campaigns to resuscitate its flagship mine, which was ordered to close in December 2023 amid anti-mining protests. The $10 billion operation accounted for about 5% of the country’s economy before its closure and generated about 40% of First Quantum’s revenue.

“What comes next — that’s exactly what we are going to start to deal with,” said Mulino in a press conference. “It’s a broad, thorny topic. The issue of the mine must be handled with great responsibility and taking into consideration national interests and protecting and benefitting Panama.”

Shares of First Quantum jumped as much as 12.6% Thursday in Toronto.

The Panamanian president spent recent weeks meeting with local businesses that relied on Cobre Panama and hearing from workers that were impacted by its closure. Some 54,000 people lost jobs, according to estimates by the National Council of Private Companies.

“It’s dramatic, what is happening,” Mulino said. “We are feeling it, in unemployment, lack of revenue for the state and in many other things like paying providers that haven’t been paid everything they are owed.”

Mulino had waited to turn his attention to the mine while completing controversial social security reforms that have now nearly passed Panama’s congress.

First Quantum on Thursday was also cleared to turn on its 300 megawatt thermal power plant in order to export the copper concentrate.

The 120,000 metric tons of idled material was “being wasted, and Panama has invested a barbarity of money into it,” Mulino said, adding that First Quantum has to reimburse Panama once the material is processed outside the country.

First Quantum, for its part, said the funds generated from the export of its copper concentrate will be used for preservation activities at the mine site.

“We reaffirm our willingness to discussions and finding the best solution together with the aim of contributing to the wellbeing of the country and all Panamanians,” the Canadian firm said in a statement posted to social media.

The prospect of a reopening remains highly uncertain. Mulino has yet to meet First Quantum’s executives, and has said he won’t negotiate with the company until it drops arbitration proceedings against Panama. The mine is also still unpopular among segments of the population due to pollution fears and the belief First Quantum got a sweetheart tax deal.

Mulino’s comments Thursday marked one of the first signs of a path forward for the embattled project.

“That 5% of GDP that we threw out the window in a single day — everyone thinks it’s a statistic,” said Mulino. “But we are feeling it.”"
2025-03-13T17:05:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/top-canadian-grocer-says-sales-of-us-products-rapidly-dropping,"Canada’s second-biggest supermarket company said a boycott of US goods is quickly taking hold in reaction to President Donald Trump’s tariffs and his threats of “economic force” to make the country the 51st US state.

“American products we are selling as a percentage of our total sales are rapidly dropping,” said Michael Medline, chief executive officer of Empire Co., which owns large chains including Sobeys and Safeway in Canada. “We have heard loud and clear from our customers that they want Canadian products.”

The Stellarton, Nova Scotia-based company typically sourced 12% of products from the US by dollar value, Medline said on the company’s fiscal third quarter earnings call Thursday — but that number is falling “and will continue to, as we shift our supply” away from US to Canadian products.

That will help offset the cost of retaliatory tariffs Canada has placed on US products and any weakness in the Canadian dollar, Medline said. Growth in sales of Canadian products has outpaced overall revenue, he said.

Empire had C$31 billion ($21.5 billion) of revenue in the 12 month-period ended Feb. 1.

Suppliers are shifting their operations to adapt to tariffs, he added — citing Swiss chocolatier Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Sprungli AG, which will now supply the Canadian market entirely from Europe, instead of 50% from the US as it did previously.

Sobeys had 21% of the Canadian grocery market, behind only Loblaw Cos., according to a 2022 report from the Retail Council of Canada. Empire shares were down 2.6% to C$43.30 at 12:43 p.m. in Toronto.

Government officials including outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have encouraged buying Canadian goods over American ones, and the country’s competition watchdog recently issued information to help people do so.

The Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on a wide variety of Canadian products last week — though it delayed the levy for goods trading under the rules of the countries’ free trade deal. Then it added 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum on Wednesday.

Canada has responded with counter-tariffs against C$60 billion of US-produced items, including an array of fresh and processed food.

“I don’t think people are interested to pay more, or to pay 25% for US product right now,” Empire Chief Operating Officer Pierre St-Laurent said on the call.

Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who’s the UAE’s national security adviser and brother of the country’s president, is slated to meet with Trump cabinet officials as soon as next week, said the people, who requested anonymity because the travel plans aren’t yet public. That would likely include Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. It’s unclear whether he will meet with the president, the people said.

Top of mind for the United Arab Emirates is its ability to buy cutting-edge chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp. The Gulf nation is vying to become a regional powerhouse for AI development, and has poured massive amounts of capital into data centers used for training AI models. But the US has limited exports of advanced chips to the UAE since 2023 and a fresh set of regulations is slated to cap the total computing power for most countries. Trump’s team is currently reviewing whether to proceed with the Biden-era rules as envisioned — or adjust them.

Sheikh Tahnoon plans to advocate for easier access to cutting-edge semiconductors and to highlight the UAE’s plans for substantial investments in tech infrastructure on American soil. That includes funding from Abu Dhabi-based MGX for a $100 billion AI infrastructure venture that President Donald Trump unveiled during his first week in office.

MGX is part of Sheikh Tahnoon’s sprawling $1.5 trillion empire, which spans everything from wealth funds to the AI company G42, which is the crown jewel of the UAE’s tech ambitions. He serves as chairman of those ventures, as well as the private investment firm Royal Group and First Abu Dhabi Bank. It’s unclear whether there will be another investment announcement during his US visit.

Spokespeople at the White House and Commerce Department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the UAE embassy declined to comment."
2025-03-13T17:16:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/trump-to-host-hochul-at-white-house-friday-to-discuss-pipeline,"President Donald Trump said he would meet with New York Governor Kathy Hochul on Friday at the White House to discuss plans for a natural gas pipeline, among other topics.

“She’s coming in tomorrow morning at nine o’clock to meet me,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

Trump said he would discuss with Hochul his ambitions for the construction of a natural gas pipeline he boasted could save New York and New England families as much as $5,000 on energy costs.

Trump didn’t explicitly name the project on Thursday but has previously made clear he is pushing to revive the Constitution Pipeline, which developer Williams Cos. scrapped in 2020 after New York blocked the project over state water quality concerns.

The company’s chief executive officer, Alan Armstrong, told Barron’s this week he was not interested in moving forward on the project unless governors of Northeastern states signed off on the plan. Armstrong separately made clear he supports the administration’s bid to get the pipeline completed.

The pipeline industry is once-bitten, twice-shy, Armstrong told Bloomberg on the sidelines of the CERAWeek by S&P Global conference in Houston. The company lost $400 million pursuing Constitution, after New York’s opposition, he said.

Earlier: Trump Vows Completion of Constitution Pipeline For New Yorkers

For US oil and gas advocates, the Constitution Pipeline has taken on symbolic status, an example of how opponents have been able to wield environmental regulations and permitting requirements to quash energy projects.

Although many parts of the Northeast US sit next to some of the country’s most bountiful natural gas reserves, limited pipeline capacity has prevented much of that supply from making it to them. Constitution promised to help change that equation by transporting Appalachian gas roughly 120 miles from Pennsylvania to New York.

“New York has held it up for years,” Trump said Thursday. “Families in New York and Connecticut and New England are going to save $5,000 a family — think of that — because right now they have the highest energy prices maybe in the world.”

“It’s just a simple pipeline going to an area that wants it,” Trump added. “I hope we don’t have to use the extraordinary powers of the federal government to get it done, but if we have to, we will.”

The president has vowed to meet with Northeast governors on the project previously, part of his broader bid to expand domestic energy infrastructure amid a surge in electricity demand.

Trump said he and Hochul were also expected to speak about other topics. That could include his administration’s push to cancel New York City’s controversial congestion pricing initiative. Hochul has said she will mount a legal challenge to the Transportation Department’s effort to revoke the toll on cars entering central Manhattan.

Hochul told reporters Thursday that she had reached out to the president “to carry on the conversation that we had in the Oval Office a couple weeks ago” when the two had met to discuss congestion pricing.

“I have a lot on my agenda. We talked about infrastructure, Penn Station, we talked about — he knows I want to talk about congestion pricing again. I want to talk about our concerns about energy in light of the tariffs,” Hochul said. “We will have quite an agenda. I look forward to the meeting tomorrow morning.”"
2025-03-13T17:20:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/republicans-step-up-attacks-on-new-esg-regulations-from-europe,"US Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee has introduced a bill that he says is designed to protect American companies from ESG regulations in Europe.

Hagerty, a Republican member of the Senate’s banking committee, proposed legislation on Wednesday in an effort to target what he described as “harmful extra-terratorial regulations.”

“American companies should be governed by US laws, not unaccountable lawmakers in foreign capitals,” Hagerty said in the proposal. “The European Union’s ideologically motivated regulatory overreach is an affront to US sovereignty.”

Confrontations between the EU and US have become routine since the November reelection of Donald Trump, with ESG emerging as a particular flashpoint. Even before Trump’s return to the White House, the GOP has regularly attacked ESG (environmental, social and governance), characterizing it as “anti-American” and “woke.”

The focus of Hagerty’s proposed bill is the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, which seeks to hold large companies accountable for ESG violations, and requires them to produce climate transition plans. Widespread opposition to CSDDD — both from within and outside the EU — led the European Commission to propose significant changes to the directive last month. Among provisions abandoned was a planned civil liability clause that would have applied to all large companies doing business in the EU.

Kim Watts, senior policy manager for the American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union — whose members include Ford Motor Co., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. — said in a recent interview that the EU “is going too far on extraterritoriality.”

Hagerty said he would use “every tool” available to block CSDDD. His proposed bill — dubbed the Prevent Regulatory Overreach from Turning Essential Companies into Targets (PROTECT USA) Act of 2025 — follows earlier warnings from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said in January that he would be willing to consider “trade tools” to retaliate against EU ESG rules.

The European Commission has said it has considered the views of all stakeholders including non-EU companies. The proposed changes are intended to ease administrative burdens on all companies, whether they’re based in the EU or elsewhere, the commission has said."
2025-03-13T17:21:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nigerian-lawmakers-reject-changes-to-consumption-company-taxes,"Nigerian lawmakers rejected changes to consumption and company taxes that were proposed by President Bola Tinubu, dealing a blow to his efforts to bolster government revenue.

Tinubu sought to double the value-added tax rate to 15% over six years to help fund the national budget and change how the revenue is distributed among Nigeria’s 36 states. His plan was opposed by powerful governors, and the House of Representatives declined to back it.

Legislators also shot down a proposal to lower the company tax rate to 25% by next year, from 30% currently, a measure that would have partially offset the VAT increase.

The government has been on a drive to simplify the tax regime, with some of the nation’s dozens of tax laws dating back to the colonial era. Lawmakers have supported some proposed changes, but they and the nation’s senators will still need to vote on them before they can be referred to the president for his assent.

Other amendments include exempting minimum-wage earners from income tax, and granting tax relief of as much as 500,000 naira ($460) to help offset their rent payments and defray rising housing costs."
2025-03-13T17:28:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/kering-picks-bad-boy-designer-demna-to-lead-gucci-turnaround-bid,"Kering SA appointed Demna Gvasalia, a designer who fueled sales growth at Balenciaga while courting controversy, as the artistic director at Gucci in a bid to revive the struggling label.

Demna, as he is known, has been at Balenciaga, which is also owned by the French luxury-goods company, since 2015. Under his creative leadership, the brand’s popularity soared as it launched sneakers such as the Triple S, which are recognizable by their exaggerated size.

Demna’s “creative power is exactly what Gucci needs,” said Francois-Henri Pinault, chairman and chief executive officer of Kering.

Kering is trying to revive growth at Gucci, which accounts for almost two-thirds of the group’s profit but has suffered from weaker demand, particularly in China. Demna is succeeding Sabato de Sarno, whose departure was announced last month after only two years at the brand, with its sales in a continuing slump.

While at Balenciaga, Demna apologized for a promotional campaign that drew criticism that it sexualized children. Demna said he was sorry for the “wrong artistic choice” behind a gifting campaign that included child models holding teddy bears clad in what appeared to be bondage gear.

Kering said last month that Gucci’s revenue fell 24% in the fourth quarter, which was worse than analysts expected. Pinault dimmed hopes for a quick turnaround, saying he doesn’t expect an improvement in demand in China this year.

The Italian label is particularly exposed to the Chinese market, and its fortunes had previously soared under designer Alessandro Michele, who preceded De Sarno and was known for his flamboyant looks. Under De Sarno, the brand embraced a more reserved esthetic.

Demna will start in the new role in July, Kering said. The brand also has a new chief executive officer, with Stefano Cantino, a former executive at LVMH’s Louis Vuitton, taking over in January.

Other luxury brands have also been affected by the slump in Chinese demand, though Kering’s French rival LVMH has been more resilient. Some of Kering’s other labels, including Balenciaga, Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta, have also generally performed better than Gucci in recent years.

Kering shares, which are down about 41% over the past 12 months, closed 0.2% higher on Thursday before Demna’s appointment was announced."
2025-03-13T17:36:00Z,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/hit-back-or-hunker-down-the-dilemma-of-responding-to-us-tariffs,"Major US trading partners have offered a range of responses to President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which took effect Wednesday. Most opted against immediate retaliation and many sounded ready to talk instead. Others took a more confrontational approach.

Here’s how the US’s main trading partners reacted initially to Trump’s well-telegraphed trade barriers on the metals:

Forceful
European Union: Brussels had the most detailed and reciprocal response, saying it will impose duties on up to €26 billion ($28 billion) of politically sensitive American goods largely from Republican-led states.

The bloc will hit beef and poultry in states like Nebraska and Kansas as well as soybeans from Louisiana, the home state of House Speaker Mike Johnson, according to a senior EU official.


The EU will immediately begin consultations with member states over the tariff lists, which are due to take effect by mid-April, giving at least a few weeks of transatlantic negotiations to play out.

The day after announcing its retaliation, the EU faced a new threat from Trump: 200% levies on US imports of European wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages. Talks between the two sides are expected soon.

“For many countries, the scale of the US market relative to their own economies mean it may not make much sense to retaliate with tariffs on American goods,” said Maeva Cousin, chief trade economist with Bloomberg Economics. “The EU stands out as the only one that may stand a chance in a one-on-one confrontation — and even it would have about twice as much to lose as the US.”

Canada: Leading up to the Wednesday deadline, Canada staked out perhaps the toughest position against Trump’s duties threats, which have extended beyond accusations of trade unfairness and into the realm of Trump’s desire to annex the US’s northern neighbor.

Canada responded to Trump’s import taxes with a series of retaliatory measures, including a 25% surcharge on electricity sent to Minnesota, New York, and Michigan from Ontario — a fee that was withdrawn after Trump threatened to double the metals tariff on Canada to 50%.

Mark Carney, the incoming prime minister, called the US “a country we can no longer trust,” and said his new government will keep its retaliatory tariffs in place “until the Americans show us respect.”

In an interview Thursday on Bloomberg Television, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called Canada’s response “tone deaf” while praising countries like Mexico and the UK that showed restraint and didn’t retaliate.

Surgical
China: Fast but measured in responding to Trump’s two previous moves to add 10% levies on all its shipments, Beijing didn’t immediately comment on Wednesday to the latest volley.


But China did summon Walmart Inc. executives over reports it asked suppliers to bear rising costs incurred by increased US tariffs.

Beijing also hit back at US accusations that China wasn’t doing enough to curb the fentanyl trade, saying that the US owes them a “big thank you” for their help so far, while calling for talks on duties.

According to Cousin’s estimates, China has targeted a hike in tariff revenues on US goods of around $5 for each $100 increase in tariff revenues enacted by Washington on Chinese goods.

Cautious
Mexico: In contrast to Canadian politicians, President Claudia Sheinbaum and her trade team have responded to the Trump administration with more restraint.

In particular, the US president has credited her government’s crackdown on fentanyl flowing over the northern border. Mexico was measured in its retaliation threats and also took steps aimed at preventing a flood of Chinese imports.

Shortly before Trump’s 25% tariffs kicked in, Mexico announced it was launching an investigation into dumping by the Chinese and Vietnamese governments of one kind of imported steel.

Sheinbaum herself characterized Mexico’s responses as “cool-headed.”

Non-Confrontational
UK: Downing Street opted against an immediate retaliation and reaffirmed its commitment to talks. Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds called the US decision to impose 25% levies on foreign metal products without exemptions “disappointing.”

Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury James Murray told Times Radio: “We’re not going to retaliate immediately in that way.” He added that Britain would “reserve our right to retaliate” in due course.


Australia: Canberra opted against any immediate retaliation, too. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese complained about Trump’s tariffs as “entirely” unjustified and an act of “economic self-harm.”

He said, “friends need to act in a way that reinforces to our respective populations the fact that we are friends. This is not a friendly act.”

Trump had told the Australian leader during talks by telephone last month that he would consider an exemption.

GLOBAL INSIGHT: Who’s Vulnerable to Trump’s Tariffs? Everyone

South Korea: Shortly after the tariffs took effect, South Korea’s Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun convened a meeting with business leaders and discussed ways to beef up their joint response.

“We will protect the interest of our industries as much as possible by further stepping up our response system before reciprocal tariffs take effect in early April,” Ahn said. He urged companies to actively reach out to US stakeholders and share details of their discussions with the government in real-time, his office said.

But South Korea, a major metals producer in Asia, refrained from taking any immediate retaliation steps. Instead, Seoul sent its trade minister to Washington to accelerate negotiations with the Trump administration.

Brazil: South America’s largest economy will be taking a reciprocal approach to the new US tariffs, only after attempting to negotiate an alternative with the Trump administration first, Finance Minister Fernando Haddad told reporters Wednesday.

Brazil Politics: Lula Balances Talks, Reciprocity on US Tariffs

“We will deal with them based on reciprocity, but first, the table for negotiations with the American government is open,” Haddad said after meeting with the head of the Brazilian Steel Institute, an industry group, in Brasilia.

Japan: The US’s fifth-largest partner in goods trade responded with regret “that the additional tariffs have been imposed without an exemption for Japan, even when Japan has explained its concerns to the US at various levels regarding this latest measure,” Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said during a regular press briefing held Wednesday."

,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/serbia-holds-interest-rates-amid-price-risks-street-protests,"Serbia’s central bank left the benchmark interest rate unchanged for a sixth month as price pressures persist and the government confronts the biggest political protests in a decade.

Policymakers kept the one-week repurchase rate at 5.75%, the National Bank of Serbia said in a statement on Thursday. The decision was expected by 14 out of 16 economists in a Bloomberg survey, while the others predicted a quarter-point cut.

Although the central bank said it expects inflation to start easing in the second quarter and approach 3% toward the end of the year, officials highlighted that it remained at the top end of the 1.5%-4.5% target range.

“It is necessary to continue to exercise a cautious monetary policy stance,” the central bank said in a statement. “It is difficult to gauge the extent to which rising protectionism worldwide and the introduction of new tariffs will affect economic activity at home, and there is also the risk that blockades and protests could lead to the deferral of some investments and consumption.”

The outlook for the economy has been clouded by months of anti-government protests triggered by a roof collapse at a railway station in November that killed 15 people. Prime Minister Milos Vucevic stepped down in January, following incidents at rallies led by university students and opposition activists.


The central bank said inflows of foreign direct investment had “slowed somewhat” since the start of the year.

President Aleksandar Vucic has warned that the demonstrations are hurting the economy and spooking foreign investors. Growth in gross domestic product reached 3.9% last year and the central bank still sees it speeding up to 4.5% in 2025.

Much of the public anger has been directed at Vucic, who has dominated Serbian politics for more than a decade. He has defied protesters’ demands for a transitional, non-partisan government and accused his foes of trying to come to power through violence instead of elections.

The authorities also need to find a solution for Serbia’s sole refiner, NIS AD, which has come under US sanctions because of its Russian owners. If the country fails to arrange a new deal for NIS in talks with the US and Russia, it risks facing higher fuel costs that would affect a broad range of products.

The central bank, which keeps the dinar in a narrow range against the euro through a so-called managed float, sold €745 million ($810 million) over the first two months to support the nation’s currency. The monetary authority sought to fend off appreciation pressures last year by buying euros on the local currency market."
